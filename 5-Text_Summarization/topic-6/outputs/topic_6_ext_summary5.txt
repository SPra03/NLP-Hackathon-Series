an affordable tablet. if were you would look at regular android tablet from reputable pc manufacturer, which is exactly what did next. this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. am going to try hard reset on it and see if that helps.not perfect, but very good bought as mother day gift. great if you are into books and streaming movies!not so much nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get startednot the best in class but priced right this feels like an affordable tablet. if were you would look at regular

not resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.tablet for the kiddo wanted something with kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. ended up buying tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than minutes with the schools it department help.terrible dont buy bought this around black friday for hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard tried multiple different micro sd cards none of which were recognized and yes formated them with every format could think of ... fat, ntfs, fat, xfat... even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps wanted to use werent in the app store and came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason bought this was to play clash of clans and cant because it wasnt on the app store... tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play coc but it didnt work... launched and played time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say returned it and bought samsung galaxy tab with s-pen and its wayyyyy better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra gb of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $...terrific purchased two fire tablets for my children. do not

brand case with fitted snap-on hard back and fold over cover that offers true protection? we now own kindles, and have been happy with every one!happy with amazon fire hd bought this amazon fire hd purely for personal travel use because dont like to bring my laptop in case if lose my laptop! this amazon fire is cheap enough that if lose it during personal travel, do not care will just buy another one. so far, am happy because the screen is big enough during internet surfing that can see whole lot better than my cell phone. hope movies work well but have not tried.ho-hum, good bad can only compare my fire hd gb to my two fire hd gb units.fire hd gb pros- wider screen better for viewing movies.- multiple small icons on home screen.- around more ram- can add microsd up to gb good value w/ discount: is lot less than the fire hd .- offers alexa, but have not figured it out .fire hd gb cons- same hd resolution.- only ghz crummy front/rear cameras, no auto-focus; rear only, w/ auto-focus.- retains panels of previously used screens: annoying to delete.- can only send prime videos to hdtv via fire stick.- no micro-hdmi port to send any content to hdtv- held horizontal, all controls and wires are awkwardly located on one side.- blue shade seems useless.- amazon brand case is too expensive and does not stand well in portrait view.- reviews for third party cases: sometimes expensive, almost always shoddy, usually fail at portrait viewwhere is the amazon brand case with fitted snap-on hard back and fold over cover that offers true protection? we now own kindles, and have

everytime..very happy with my purchasegreat to read variety of books it has clear screen, the books are easy to download, like the other features as well.great to use and handy here are my pros and cons thus far.pro:perfect size for ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketchild accounts- amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil johnny can play clash of clans and how much he can hit the ol' visa card for.battery life thus far; wife was on it for about hours last night and battery was at about %kindle integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my kindle books look greatgreat to watch movies like to watch movies on it. was hoping to use the pen since when access it, may have dirty fingers after using my tools.great! really enjoyed this product, books, music, weather, news at my finger tip. did not think at first that would like this size but it is perfect for me. they do not have some of the games that you can download on an android market but other then that the tablets overall are great especially for kids sense they have child browsing adult browsing with parental locks.great tablets for reading books love this tablet have had several others but this brand works everytime..very happy with my
