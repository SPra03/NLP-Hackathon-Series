## Extractive and Abstractive Summarization with LSA, BERT, KL-sum, and T5
This is a text summarization model that uses a combination of LSA, BERT, KL-sum, and T5 algorithms to generate an extractive summary of a given topic.

### Workflow
The model workflow involves the following steps:

1. Input data: For PDF and TXT files, the model gets the file names using get_files function, while for CSV files, it gets the dataframe containing the text.
2. Clean data: The model extracts the introduction, abstract, and conclusion (if present) from the file or the first 5000 letters. The text cleaning is performed, which involves removing stopwords, digits, brackets, and converting certain words.
3. LSA applied: The model selects the most frequent words among the text and generates the output summary. The number of output sentences is set to 5 or 4 depending upon the number of files in a topic.
4. BERT applied: The model applies BERT on the output generated by LSA, and saves the abstractive summary from BERT.
5. KL-sum applied: The model applies KL-sum algorithm on the BERT summary and generates 50 sentences summarizing the topic.
6. T5 applied: The model applies T5 algorithm on the KL-sum output to generate the final summary.

### Functions
The model has several functions such as text_cleaning, get_files, fun_lsa, fun_t5, fun_kl, fun_part_1, and fun_part_2. Each of these functions performs specific tasks such as text cleaning, LSA, BERT, KL-sum, and T5 algorithm.

### Features
The model assumes an average word size of 10 and thus, extracts the first 5000 letters from intro and abstract, and adds some words from the conclusion to get the chunk of text for cleaning. The model removes stopwords for some topics while keeps them for others to balance between the readability and coverage of the final summary.

The model uses BERT for abstractive summarization and KL-sum for extractive summarization. BART and GPT were also experimented with, but only on a small sample. BERT was selected as it gave better results on that sample.

The T5 algorithm generates and presents the information in a semantic way, providing an overall summary of the topic.

### Conclusion
In summary, this text summarization model provides an efficient and effective way of summarizing a large amount of text data in a concise and informative manner.
