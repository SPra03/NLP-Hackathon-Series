"AT LAST . . . ONE THAT 'WORKS' 29 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No With an Income Tax Preparation practice I'm on my laptop 10 hours a day entering data. Using the laptop keyboard and mouse pad on the flat and level angle that laptops offer is stressful. An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. This AmazonBasic Ventilated and Adjustable laptop stand is perfect and produces the effect of a typewriter slant for those who grew up on IBM Selectrics or Royals. Fully adjustable for just about any angle you are comfortable with. Well made, light weight and it looks as a 'piece of the laptop' in sight. One small warning: the tabs on the front end that keep your laptop from sliding off may be a bit short for some laptops. The tabs rise only .75 of an inch (3/4). My current, and several past laptops, the front sits 1.0 inches (1) at top front but slanting down at .75 of an inch (3/4) inward. The slant keeps the tabs on the stand from holding the laptop in place - causing the laptop to slip down and off. Simple solution to this: Binder Clips. Use the medium size binder clip, one on each of the stand tabs. You can find 'binder clips' on the Amazon web site. A box is under 4 but you only need 2 medium binder clips so . . . check with a school teacher or office worker and get two for free. Other than that, the right tool at the right price. Buy one and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did."
"Cool running 10 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba seems to occasionally do. So that is my only con for this item. I would still suggest buying it."
"Great adjustment angles! Laptop Runs Super Cool! No Vibration and Sturdy! 28 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Can't seem to say enough about this awesome stand. This allows me to utilize my laptop monitor and a second flawlessly. The cord keep on the back is great as well. I am about to purchase another monitor and with the choices of adjustment angle, this stand should place the two screens side by side perfectly for that one as well.There is no vibration through the metal as the contacts on the bottom are padded. The fan on my laptop almost never comes on even during day long uploads to the cloud due to this stand having it suspended in air on mesh.Very, very glad I made this purchase. Easily worth much more than I paid, the options for adjustment angles are ample, and lets my expensive baby run cool. Buy with confidence!"

Hurts your wrists after just 5 minutes 21 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No The two guard stops at the bottom are WAY TOO HIGH. They dig into my wrists are are painful after only 5 minutes.Everything else about the stand is excellent for a 13 laptop. It'll only work if you use an extended keyboard.Impossible to type directly on the laptop b/c of poor design. The guards just need to be brought down and 1/2 their size and this would be perfect.
"Just what I was looking for... I mostly use my laptop on my lap. Go figure. I have a 17 inch laptop and have tired a few other portable laptop holders, all plastic, and they have all broken with in a couple of months. This one is metal but still lightweight. It also has the added value of having a flat, perforated base which makes it more comfortable in my lap and it gives me a place to place peripherals such as external hard drives. I am very happy with this product and recommend it."
"Nothing to plug in! Cool! 71 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos."

"Simple but practicle This is simple, well made and appears to be durable. The size means that I can sit in my favorite chair with my laptop. Other units that I have used were either larger than I wanted, or overly complicated and subject to breakage."
"Very sturdy, metal, uncomfortable. If you're looking for something to keep your laptop cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend.."
"A good, basic backpack that is a very good value This is a very basic, functional backpack that does the job that it when designed for. Unlike other, more expensive models, this one does not have the feel or look of something that you would show off to your friends. However, it holds my 16 laptop quite well and has enough pockets to contain all of my usual travel gear. The material seems to be fairly durable but it makes a crinkly sound when touched or moved. This would be a good choice for a teenager who is hard on his belongings."
A perfect Laptop Backback I purchase two of these backpacks for my wife and son's laptops. The case is well constructed and has many compartments. Its a great backpack for the price.
Backpack Love the backpack....lots of pockets for all my needs...when i travel it fits everything for my travel...makes a lot easier
beware of size Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. Otherwise great product
"Fits a 17.3 laptop quite snuggly, but... The bag fits a 17.3 laptop quite snuggly, but it fits nonetheless. There is a considerable amount of space in each of the available sections, along several accessory pockets for those smaller items. The 2 mesh side pockets are big enough for a standard plastic water bottle, but not big enough for a nalgene water bottle.Taking it on a couple destinations so if there are any issues I find with it, I will edit my comments accordingly. As it stands now, good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops."
Five Stars Love it
Four Stars Great for the price It's much more durable than anything I could get at Walmart.
"Good quality but the laptop compartment is not padded enough. The backpack is great quality. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I wouldn't trust the laptop slot alone to protect my laptop. It's not padded enough. If I had a choice I'd rather the laptop slot be replaced with a waterproof cooler space as I purchased this for hiking. That is my only gripe, other than that the bag is great quality, comfortable and has plenty of space. Well worth the price."
"Good quality, too many zippers Too many zippers IMO. Good quality, but the zippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open."
great backpack... well worth the money Amazing..... Sturdy and well pocketed.... Well worth the investment...very happy with this purchase. It has been holding up quite nicely.
"Great basic backpack that compares favorably with better known brand name packs PROS:Well made/good constructionCompares very favorably to famous brand-name packsNo obvious brandingGreat attention to detailLarge main compartmentLots of subcompartmentsOrganizer for pens/sundries in the front compartmentCONS:Generic looksTop handle is minimally padded/perfunctoryStiff nylon in some interior parts makes an audible 'crinkly' sound when movedThe AmazonBasics Laptop Backpack is a well-made, fully featured backpack that can accommodate laptops up to 17 inches wide. This is a simply designed but good looking backpack that could meet most students' needs.The bag is basically a simple, but stylish enough design, with grey highlights and some orange piping on the front. There are enough characteristics to make the bag distinctive but there is no obvious branding on the front. If you look closely, you can find the Amazon basics logo embossed on the black zippers. But you'd have to look really closely. The shoulder straps are backed with a mesh-like material that reduces slippage and are sufficiently wide and padded so that they are comfortable.The main compartment is generous in size, open and closed with two zippers, and is basically broken up into two areas. The back area is generously padded on both sides and is meant to house the laptop. The padding is as good as or even more generous than what I have seen in standard backpacks made by companies like JanSport or L.L. Bean. There is a single large sleeve in front of the padding that is large enough to hold a standard, letter-sized manilla folder filled with papers. The front compartment is basically wide open and has room for traditional textbooks (assuming people still use these) or any other paraphernalia.There are two compartments in the front. There is mid-sized compartment that is in front of the main compartment and a smaller front compartment with the obligatory organizer/pockets to hold pens, a cellphone etc. There is even an internal clip in the front compartment for keys.Additionally, there are small mesh pockets on the sides of the pack and a quick-access, zippered pocket on the very top of the pack. There's even a small mesh pocket on the bottom of the left shoulder strap.Although I doubt that this is ballistic nylon, it appears to be very well made. The edges line up very well and there is no dog-earing in the fabric. The top handle is only minimally padded and a bit flimsy for a pack this size. Clearly, you could lift the pack via the handle to move it from the floor to your desk, but the handle isn't comfortable or sturdy enough to carry the pack like a suitcase. The nylon that makes up the dividers is stiff and makes an audible crinkly sound when manipulated. This likely will go away over time, but if you are late to class and walking into a quiet lecture hall this could be a distraction.The zippers move easily. They are large enough to grip and they all have nylon tags sewn to the end to make them easier to pull. The zippers seem strong enough for a pack of this size and caliber.All-in-all this is a very well made back pack at an excellent price point. It may not win major style points for some students, but it is a great basic backpack."
"Great for traveling. I ordered this backpack in anticipation of a 10-day vacation to Universal Studios and a Royal Caribbean cruise. I needed something to carry my laptop where I could easily remove it for security, and that had lots of pockets for my travel papers and various things I needed to keep my 6yo busy.This AmazonBasics laptop is well-made and sturdy with a variety of pocket sizes and places to put stuff. Whatever material they used for the inside of the bag makes it very loud and crinkly, but also easy to clean. There is at least one pocket that seems extraneous and almost gets in the way, and when all the pockets are closed, there is an over abundance of zipper pulls. But the bag traveled very well and I like the sleeker style of it.The backpack is a bit much for everyday use (just in bulk and number of pockets, etc), but I'm happy to have it for future travels."
Great stuff I was expecting the backpack to be a little flimsy consider the price but it's great. The padding for my back and the laptop pocket is nice and thick. There is even a secondary pocket on the front of the laptop pouch that can fit my 8 tablet. Overall I really like it because it has so many pockets and little compartments. The only bad thing I can see about it is how they made it so cheap is that the material inside for like the pockets and stuff is really flimsy so it'll be easily punctured by pens and pencils and stuff. For me though that's no big deal because the outside of it is sturdy and will keep my stuff safe.
"Great tech bag for great price. Very nice bag with lots of compartments and plenty of room for laptop, tablet, notebook, and accessories. I especially like cinch straps to adjust the width to your items. Top zippers were a little tight at first, but quickly loosened up."
"I like all the different pockets to keep all my gear ... AmazonBasics delivers a top quality backpack for the price. I like all the different pockets to keep all my gear organized. The material used to make the backpack are light weight but very strong. Works great for traveling and held everything I needed to travel with. I recommend this backpack to anyone who travels with a large laptop, my 17 inch fit perfectly."
"Main pocket does not open wide as I would like This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone."
many department for my idems and is perfectly design fitted ... many department for my idems and is perfectly design fitted for my needs.
"Nice Bag and great price Lots of pockets, but zipper covers actually make opening and closing a bit more difficult."
"not a good thing with these heavy South Florida rains Delivered as promised, well packaged ... only problem ... does NOT appear to be waterproof ... not a good thing with these heavy South Florida rains."
"Not Bad But A Little Too Bulky There's a lot of space with the Amazon Basics laptop and a number of great compartments, but the material it's made from feels kind of stiff and inexpensive. I was impressed at how much I could get into this backpack, but once it was packed it felt very big and bulky. My normal backpack is a smaller one from Timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one."
"One of the best backpacks I've ever owned Even though this is classified as a laptop backpack, I'm really finding it much more useful as an all-purpose backpack. Of course, you could carry your laptop in it - there's a compartment specifically designed for one (17 or less) - but it's also comfortable and useful for general use.The backing is very sturdy. This sturdiness is designed to protect a laptop from tumbles and falls, but I love it for other reasons: First, I can throw all sorts of junk in this backpack (big books, a lunchbox, shoes, etc.) and nothing bulges from the back. This happens often with other backpacks, causing them to be difficult to carry, but the sturdy backing prevents this here. Second, it is quite comfortable. It's not a hard plastic backing, but just seems to be rigidly padded, and it almost feels like it's helping my posture when I wear it.My only complaint, and it isn't a big one, is that there are almost too many pockets and organizational compartments. It can get a bit complicated remembering where something is, especially if you have a lot of stuff. This may just take a bit more getting used to, however, and it doesn't diminish the fact that this is a really great backpack. In fact I'd add that all this extra room inside the backpack is a bonus. Yes, I am really quite liking this backpack."
"Perfect no. of compartments Pros- Feels Light weight even when stuffed fully. Perfect no. of compartments.Cons - Poor zipper quality, side ouch for water container is small."
Sturdy Well made. Seems sturdy. Multiple compartments to store gear.Very price effective compared to other products made for the same uses.I'll see how it holds up with time.
"Winner I'm a lifelong backpack user, starting back after WW2 when my father outfitted us all with Army surplus items. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to hike we go. Or snowshoe. Oh, it was a different world then, and I'm not saying better. The equipment was heavy and prone to mildew if you weren't careful, as it was all made of natural fiber with metal fittings. And they hadn't yet heard of ergonomicsHere we have yet another AmazonBasics product that is a winner. An improved, contemporary version of that old military surplus that first accompanied us into the woods - I've followed a lifetime of upgrades. This is a nice big bag with lots of pockets and zippers. Like most of today's technical products, it is a tradeoff between total protection and portability. So no, you wouldn't throw this with your laptop inside and expect complete protection. But it is made of high quality nylon and other tekkie fabrics, has adequate padding and well shaped, comfortable pack straps, a handle on top where it belongs, and more straps, buckles and pockets here and there. I love straps, buckles and pockets.It can be expected to be water resistant, although for extended use in rain you would need a separate rain cover made of coated waterproof nylon. This backpack has a very pleasing look, mostly black with orange accents and is a nice conservative shape. And it is a very good value, which you will discover if you go shopping at the well-known places for this kind of thing."
"Zipper issue. Otherwise good. Zipper on front kept coming apart. Since this opens to the base of the backpack, I almost lost an item. Double check this when you get it give it a few solid tugs"
"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as.... 25 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack.

It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better.

"Perfect. 339 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No Recently, I spent my hard earned money on a 13.3 Macbook Pro Mid 2012. I like to take care of my personal belongings, and this 1000 piece of machinery was no exception. So this began my search for a laptop sleeve. Wandering my local general stores (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc.) I noticed a cheap laptop sleeve (as in cheap quality) was nearly 16! I was like HECK NO! So I jumped on Amazon (btw amazon is the best shoutout to all the hard workers running this website and service) and searched a laptop sleeve. After approximately 9.24 seconds of searching I came across this gem. COULD IT BE! An affordable, durable, and classy laptop sleeve for under 10. Being the educated consumer I started to read reviews. I came across a few that said: Laptop Didn't Fit. This was it, this was the end, I built it all up to let myself down. But being the poor High-School student I am, I pocketed some of my parents lunch money and ordered it. When it got here I opened the package. You know the scene in Star Wars when Darth Vader removed his mask That's what it was like, shocking, but beautiful. I unboxed it and immediately took my laptop out of my backpack (which was stored in a nice soft tee-shirt previous to this sleeve purchase) and tried to slip it in the case. Wow. The sleeve fit like a glove.If you have a 13.3 Macbook Pro Mid 2012, I highly recommend this product. It protects your laptop very well and snug. No other sleeve is as affordable, fashionable, and durable as this one."

"birthday present The larger one was bought for me as part of a Christmas gift...I enjoyed mine so much that I bought this one for a birthday gift.....sturdy, stylish, padded and protects well. Good buy for the price"
Four Stars For the price very good value and its lasting well
"great deal quick ship a must have ! holds everything laptop,amp,mini external memory drive,headphones,3d glasses,tablet cables,and still have 2 extra pockets awesome,well made product. thank you !"
"Great for the price Very nice product for the money. Only use it once a week, should last long time, would buy again."
Great Notebook Case I purchased this case based on appearance and quality as shown on the picture with details. I was even more impressed upon arrival. The case has everything I need. A separate compartment for my A/C power cord. The padding is well constructed to protect my Notebook Computer. Well worth every cent I paid. I am extremely please by all the features.
"Great value Was not what I expected, he price was so low that I expected a, runner-up, type of bag but this is perfect. Delighted with it."
"Great value! This is a quality product, well constructed with durable materials. Many pockets for laptop accessories or other supplies. Sometimes I use it as just a briefcase and it also serves that purpose well. All in all, it's a great value for a reasonably low price."
inconvenient to Use. I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens.
"Just what I wanted Cheap but doesn't appear it particularly. Does it's job fine, plenty of pockets and space, much prefer it to the back pack style"
"Laptop Bag I needed a reasonable laptop bag and got this.On arrival I put my dell Inspiron laptop inside and the charger went in the front pocket. Inside the laptop slips in the middle then your are able to put a ipad and maybe a diary either side. As there is a slide pocket each side of the laptop.It's actually well made surprisingly and the handles on top are nice and comfortable to use/hold.The strap that goes over the should is nice, maybe could of had more padding on the shoulder strap.The reason for 4 stars is that I think the case should have more padding to protect your electrical device.It's a very nice bag and I do recommend it and for the price it is great."
"Laptop Case Having looked elsewhere for this product and found them really expensive, found this on Amazon at a fantastic price and was really pleased with it."
Laptop Case I am a Verizon Technician and this laptop case is perfect for what I do!! Thank you!

"Overall nice bag Fits well, small from outside but inside it is big, thanks"
"Professional. I liked this item for the price,quality and usability. Ideal for Laptops, tablets,paperwork and sandwiches.It comes with carry handle or Over the shoulder straps. Quality from Amazon"

Amazon powerfast wall charger Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
awesome I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly!
Confident quality I was in line at a store where a elder women was trying to return a Amazon tablet. The customer service rep told her she used a charging block that had caused damage to the tablet and it wasn't covered for replacement. I happy to purchase a charging block that was made for my device.
correct plug for kindle Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package
Disappointed I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/
Fast Charger Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great.
Fast charger This product works just as well as the higher-priced ones from the cell phone company.
"Fast charger, worth the money Bought this to use with my kindle voyage and I love it. It charges my Kindle in 3 hours or less sometimes and the battery lasts for weeks."
"Gets the job done Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger."
Good Charges all my items extra fast. Love it when I'm short on time
Good Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good charger This wall charger works exactly as described for the Kindle Paperwhite.
"Good plug I assumed this item would have a cord with the plug. Never assume. It was the plug only. The cord on my 7"" Kindle is very short so I bought a 4 foot cord also. Now I keep the shorter cord with me so I can charge on the go, the longer cord and new plug are what I use at home. Satisfied"
"good product pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand"
Grea gift for my wife My son and I bought my wife the Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and she loves it! This charger is great for trips where we need a charge in the vehicle or while visiting relatives!
Great charger Bought this for my new Kindle since they no longer come with chargers. It's fast and can be used for my phone.
"Great charger for the Kindle Fire Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up."
"Great charger, very fast This is the third I have had to buy/ They seem to only work for a year before needing to be replaced. I have the warranty but no patience for the replacement to be mailed to me with all the forms."
Great charger! Love it. Best charger I ever bought. Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone.
Great charger! This charger is improved from the other one I had. It takes less time to fully charge and the charge lasts longer.
Great item Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well.
"Great Service, great purchase I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable."
I prefer to get power directly. Hey--It works. I prefer to get a battery recharge direct from the source instead of from my computer. The cord is convenient.
It's a wall charger Wall charger is convenient. Just wish it was sold with the kindle instead of having to purchase it separate. Seems like it should be standard in the package. Had to purchase in a bundle in order to get it included with kindle.
Kindle Quick Charger Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!
Nice one Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable
not any faster it does not charge any faster than regular charger.
"Required to charge your Kindle. The only problem that I had is that it should have been included with the Kindle Paperwhite. There is no way to charge the Paperwhite unless you buy the charger. The charging port on the Paperwhite is so small that nothing that I already have will work. Kindle does not even provide a USB cable so that you can charge from your computer. The outlet plug is cheep plastic (hollow) and will probably break, no warranty."
Satisfied It does what it is suppose to. No problems with it...
Spot On! Exactly what I needed. Didn't want to settle for a generic off brand charger. Thanks to Best Buy I didn't have to.
"useful charger This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily"
"Very happy with product I purchased this wall charger because I have had issues with Samsung and other Kindle chargers. So far, this charger is great. Devices charge rapidly."
"Why only 4? I gave this Amazon charger only four stars, because even though it does a great job of charging my new Paperwhite quickly it should be included with the reader and not sold separately."
Works good Works good for a plug in for the kindle fire that I bought
works great just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.
"Works great Replacement charger for my son's Kindle, works great, highly recommended."
"Yet to fail... Hey it's only a wall charger...Hey it's only a wall charger...Hey it's only a wall charger... Yet to fail, nough said."
". Nice hand sized tablet While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
2nd purchase I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.
3rd time is the charm I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.
"5 star service bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier."
7 year old granddaughter loves it This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
"8"" fire 16gb tablet I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)"
A cheap tablet I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
A gift She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
A gift for a very appreciative grandson Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own .
"A gift for Grandma A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing."
a Good buy The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
"A good buy! This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped."
"A good improvement over previous models My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
"A good step up from my old kindle tablet The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
A good value The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
A great buy I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!
A great buy Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost.
A great gift! My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.
"A great replacement tablet My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!"
A great starter tablet for a youngster Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
"A Great Tablet for a Great Price This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!"
"A little hard to use Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
A lot for a little Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed.
"A mediocre tablet Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive."
"A MUST if you have Amazon Prime I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
"A nice Kindle Reader A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
A nice upgrade This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version.
"A nice upgrade to my old kindle. I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
A perfect gift for grandkids!! Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
A Quality Product I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.
A snappy tablet! The Kindle Fire HD 8 is great for users of all types!
"A Solid Basic Tablet I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
A very good deal I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
"Absolute love it Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!"
"Absolutely awesome This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.)"
Absolutely great I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device .
"Absolutely Great Start Up Tablet I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it's a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that's alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games!"
"Adequate 8"" Tablet I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste."
"Adequate entry level tablet This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
"Ads ads and ads If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
Affordable Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems
Affordable quality Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.
"Affordable Tablet Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!"
"Alexa is great! Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money."
All about the free play The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.
almost perfect this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
Always a good purchase This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal
Amazing I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.
Amazing I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!
"Amazing for the price Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones"
Amazing product Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it
Amazing Size. Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
"Amazing tablet for the price I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up."
Amazing Tablet with an Amazing Price Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
"Amazing Tablet!! The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great."
Amazing! I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
Amazon Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 16gb - Wi-fi The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 32gb Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.

amazon 8 inch 4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.
"Amazon 8"" HD Tablet The latest Amazon 8"" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet"
Amazon fire Excellent tablet for the price. We bought it as a child's tablet to surf and play games. Has tons of free apps for kids.
Amazon Fire For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
Amazon Fire I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.
Amazon Fire I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!!
Amazon fire I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
"Amazon Fire If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
amazon fire my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
"Amazon Fire 8HD It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it."
"Amazon Fire does what I need it for - great for me Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot."
"Amazon Fire HD I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it."
"Amazon Fire HD This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
"Amazon Fire HD 8 16 GB ( 6th Generation) I'm truly elated with the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet. I originally purchased this product specifically to attached to my Tablet Holder on my Nordic Track Treadmill, which already has a built-in tablet. However, I was so taken back by the versatility of the Fire HD 8 tablet that I decided to use the tablet as my everyday ""walk-about"" computer tablet instead on placing on my treadmill which I only use 1 to 3 times per week. I totally recommend the Fire HD 8 Tablet which on sale cost about $69.00."
"Amazon Fire HD 8 pad We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10"" version."
amazon fire hd8 meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
Amazon fire HD8 Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
Amazon fire tablet Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
Amazon fire tablet Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use.
Amazon Fire Tablet Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
Amazon Fire Tablet Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
"amazon fire! Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!"
AMAZON FIRE.....AMAZING! The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it!
"Amazon HD 8 I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely."
"Amazon is amazing For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
Amazon is the best This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
Amazon Kindle FIRE hd-8 Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire.
"Amazon Lover I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
Amazon tablet Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
"Amazon tablet This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
"Amazon tablet This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
"An average Fire tablet Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
An easy & convenient device! This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!
An excellant product. This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
"An excellent E-reader I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life."
An improvement from my original Kindle? This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.
"Another great tablet If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
App options pathetic Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed
April love best buy Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy

Awesome Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must
Awesome Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution
Awesome I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.
Awesome I have been using this for a bit now. It's wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer.
Awesome I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
Awesome It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
Awesome Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account

Awesome affordable tablet. Great for kids! Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised me.

"Awesome product, very light Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you."
"Awesome product! Amazing Price! My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working."
Awesome product. Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it
Awesome reader Picture quality is so much nicer than my old reader.
Awesome tab for the price. Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.

"Awesome tablet This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all!"
Awesome tablet Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly
Awesome tablet for a small fee. If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
Awesome tablet for kids Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad
"Awesome tablet for me I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses."
Awesome tablet for my nephew My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.
Awesome tablet! Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!

Awesome! This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!
Awesome!value for money Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.
"Awsome Tablet Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults."
"Awsome Tablet and great price Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos."
"Bang for the buck . . . If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
"Bargain tablet Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
basic but good Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
basic kindle upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
basic tablet I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
"Battery life is awesome! I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift."
Beautiful Tablet This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
"Beginner tablet for our 9 year old son. Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
"Beginner to Tablets I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
"Best Amazon Tablet Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa."
best at it price very good product in its price range affordable and very good
Best bang for the buck ! We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
"Best bang for your buck This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds."
"Best budget tablet I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
Best budget tablet period This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price.
"Best buy for the kids ever! I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
Best buy for the kids! One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
"Best Buy for your buck I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
"Best Buy, literally This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it's worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:)"
"Best companion for Amazon users I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance."
Best deal Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.
"Best deal on a reader tablet I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader."
Best gift My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
Best gift for Beginers Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.
Best gift we bought this year! Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
"Best Kindle owned This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
Best Kindle to date Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
Best one to date! This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
"Best price Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc"
"Best product for this price range Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
Best Quality Tablet Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school.
"Best tablet backed by Amazon The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
"Best Tablet Choice Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
"Best tablet ever I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids."
"Best tablet for kids! I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!!"
Best tablet for price I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
Best tablet for the price I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.
Best tablet for under 200$ I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
"Best tablet on the market Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
"Best tablet right now This tablet is one of the best.You won't regret buying this one.Good work,Amazon."
"Best Tablet under $100 This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
Best value for a tablet Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
"Better than before This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse."
"Better than ever Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it."
Better than expected Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.
"Better than expected for the price I purchased the Fire Tablet basically as an e-reader. However, after finding out how to install the Google Play Store, it is much more. Nothing speedy or top of the line, but what would one expect for the price. No regrets!"
Better than the kindle fire 6 Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.
Better than the Kindle HD 7 Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
Better then my first kindle i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read
Big Fan I have owned a kindle before & prefer it to an ipad
"Big upgrade from the 7"" Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
"Big upgrade from the 7"" Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
"bigger IS better I already had the Kindle Fire 7"", and this KF8 not only has a bigger picture screen but is faster."
Bigger screen is nice. Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it's so much faster!
Birthday gift Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
"Birthday Present My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did."
"Bought 2 Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night."
Bought as a gift Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
Bought as a Gift Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .
Bought as a gift We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly.
Bought as a replacement Better then the older models bigger and better then before
Bought for 5 year old. Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
"Bought for a friend, he loves it. I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names."
"Bought for a gift Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
"Bought for daughter Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
Bought for Mom. She enjoys it Bought it for mothers day and she hasn't put it down yet.
"Bought for Senior and Preteen I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
Bought this for Wife. She loves it Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again!
Broke in 5 mos I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
Budget priced and Easy to use This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
"Burned by fire I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
Came mostly set up. Easy to use. Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.
can download audio books it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.
"Can't beat if for the price What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
"Can't beat it! This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
Can't go wrong These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.
"Capable tablet at a bargain price. Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
CHEAP OPTƒ∞ON ƒ∞t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs

Christmas gift Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.
Christmas Gift I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
Christmas gift Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.
Christmas gift This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.
Christmas gift This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.
"Christmas gift This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!"
Christmas gift for hubby. I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.
Christmas gift for hubby. I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn't downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them.
"Christmas gift for my daughter She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
Christmas gift for wife Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
Christmas gifts Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update
Christmas present Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
Christmas present my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
"Christmas present This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
Christmas Purchase Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.
Clear & crisp! Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
"Color difference is HUGE. Bad customer service. I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
"Compact computer Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer"
"Compact, easy, no service agreement. Great Item When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn't know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need."
Computer in my palm I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
Convenient to carry around Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
Cool product Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
corporate consultant great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
Couldn't be happier w/ Amazon Fire HD Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!
"Couldn't possibly hate it more. I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet."
Daughter loves it Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!!
Daughter loves it Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
"Daughter Loves This Tablet Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?"
dead This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
decent beginner tablet I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs .
"Decent for the price This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market."
Decent tablet good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
"Decent Tablet Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work."
Decent tablet We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
"Decent Tablet - For the price Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
"Decent tablet but not high caliber The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
Decent Tablet for Teen Basic Games This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
Decent tablet. Good tablet althought the availability of apps thru their appstore is limited.
"Decent.... Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well..."
"Disappointed Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight."
"Disappointed I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
"Disappointed I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!"
"Disappointed I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE"
Disappointed no access to Apps without credit card Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
"Disappointed with device, Mfg, and seller I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
Does all that I need. Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.
"Does not work well for multiple children If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product."
Does the job Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
"Does the job I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."

"Does the job most of the time If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to."
Doesn't stay on I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
"Dual Use I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
Durable I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!
Ease of use Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
"Easy Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it."
"Easy and Convenient This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
"Easy and intuitive It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it"
Easy play Apps Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
"Easy reader Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."

"Easy set up, easy to use We bought this for my Mother in Law for Mother's Day. She's not very tech but she's had no problem using."
"Easy set up, easy to use We bought this for my Mother in law who isn't very tech savvy. She has no problems using"
Easy tablet to use I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further.
"Easy to get working and smooth transfer of account Bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other Fire deceased. It was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. She has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. Due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. Otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use."
"Easy to learn to use its many features. Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
"Easy to navigate, great product Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
"Easy to navigate, great product Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
"Easy to operate and read. Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read."
"easy to operatedownloaded alot of books love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone"
"Easy to read, but loses charge fast I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
"EASY TO SET UP AND USE BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"

Easy to Use The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!

Easy to use for beginner or advanced user! This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
Easy to use for reading or watching shows Love the easy use of the system and the lots of books you can get from amazon
"Easy to use, economical My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!"
"Easy to use, with good, clear screen display. This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
"Easy to use; minimal set-up needed My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
Easy to use. Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift.
Easy to use. Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
"Easy to use. I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
"Easy to watch movies, play games and read books it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
Easy to watch videos I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
Easy use This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
Easy use. Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
Ended up returning I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
"Enjoy I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer."
Enjoy it Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games
Enjoyable This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.
"Enjoyable Tablet I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!"
Enjoying my new tablet I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.
Enter than I thought Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
"Equal to the other tablet (ipad) I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok"
"Even better than before I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
even my 70 year old mom can use it! purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
Everything good you expected Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
Everything we needed Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
Everything you expect Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
"Everything you expect from Amazon This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
Exactly what we wanted. Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
Exceeded my expectations I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
"Exceeds my expectations I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
"Excelent Tablet I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."

Excellent Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work.
Excellent Amazing HD 8 Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.
Excellent basic tablet This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech.
Excellent budget tablet Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire.
"Excellent buy Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."

Excellent buy for kids We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
Excellent buy! Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!
Excellent buying experience This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.

"Excellent choice for my mom My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
"Excellent Device bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied."
Excellent device Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use.
Excellent for price For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
Excellent for reading Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time
Excellent for simple games and social media. I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
"Excellent for the price paid I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use."
Excellent for what it does it Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said!
"Excellent Gift Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can't comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me."
"Excellent gift I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it."
"Excellent gift for kids This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
"Excellent HD8 16GB Tablet I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
Excellent I pad Easy to use and great value. Excellent viewing with good color
"Excellent Kindle Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot."
Excellent Kindle Fire I really like the large screen. Excellent graphics
"excellent low price tablet I'm not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more."
"Excellent Portable Media Device / Backup Tablet This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
"Excellent Price Point. I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase."
"Excellent product Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
Excellent product Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things .
Excellent Product Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
Excellent product I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
"Excellent Product I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
"Excellent Product I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!"
"Excellent product & Excellent service, per usual! This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!"
Excellent product but granddaughter wanted an iPad I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.

EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR PRICE Great quality picture and sound for the price! Easy to navigate through menu's and app's.
Excellent product for the price This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It's very responsive and the screen resolution is great.
"Excellent reader Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
Excellent reader Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading...
Excellent reader Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
"Excellent Reading Tablet Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended."
Excellent size The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
"Excellent tablet great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products."
"Excellent tablet I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet"
"Excellent tablet I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far."
Excellent tablet I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.
Excellent Tablet The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
"Excellent Tablet This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
"Excellent Tablet Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8"" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended."
"Excellent tablet and battery life Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot."
Excellent tablet at great price. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
Excellent tablet for a gift I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.
"Excellent tablet for email, Facebook and media. I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied."
"Excellent Tablet for Entertaiment This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
"Excellent tablet for games, reading, email, photos Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations."
"Excellent tablet for moderate use at a great price I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too."
"Excellent tablet for my kids. I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
"Excellent tablet for the family I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster."
"Excellent tablet for the money Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
"Excellent Tablet for the money Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
"Excellent tablet for the money Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend."
Excellent tablet for the money With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
Excellent tablet for the price I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
"Excellent tablet for the price! On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!"
Excellent tablet for the price. I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.
Excellent tablet! Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.
Excellent tablet! ! Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.
Excellent value For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube
"Excellent value It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
"Excellent value Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value."
"Excellent Value Upgraded from a6"" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don't think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size."
"Excellent, inexpensive tablet Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
"Excellent!!! Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
Excellent!!! Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo!
"expanded storage can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup."
Extremely good value !!!! The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.
"Extremely Happy I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating."
Fabulous easy tablet This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!
fabulous! I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
"Fan of Amazon fire With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
"Fantastic Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended."
"Fantastic Buy! I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions."
"Fantastic for light internet access. Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet."
"fantastic purchase bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this."
Fantastic purchase My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
"Fantastic so nice bought it 3x I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!"
"Fantastic Tablet for kids I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
"Fantastic Tablet for the price This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
Fantastic tablet for the price! My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon!
Far exceeded my expectations First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
Fast and reliable This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures!
"Fast but screen not as big as ipad mini Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
Fast Tablet This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
"Favorite of any tablet The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
"Fine for reading Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
"Fine tablet It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side."
Fire The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
Fire We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.
Fire 2 Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
Fire 8 HD I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
Fire 8 hd I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
"Fire 8 talbet Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life"
Fire HD I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
"Fire HD This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended."
Fire hd We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
Fire HD 8 Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member.
"Fire HD 8 I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
"Fire HD 8 Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books."
"fire hd 8 seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1"
Fire HD 8 The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
"Fire HD 8 Color Orange The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
"fire hd 8 nice screen The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets."
"Fire Hd 8 tablet Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but"
"Fire HD tablet I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it."
"Fire HD tablets It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
"Fire HD8 Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase."
"Fire HD8 Tablet I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
fire tablet I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
Fire Tablet Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
"Fire Tablet - great for entertainment I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
"Fire works for me Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
"Fire_HD The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
First Amazon FIRE Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
First one Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great
First tablet I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot.
"First Tablet I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things."

"First Tablet. Lots of possibilities. Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
For a friend She says this was the best gift she ever received.
"For a toddler!! purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!"
For grandkids Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
For Mom This was just the right screen size. We were price shopping and luckily found it on sale too.
"For my 3 Yr Old Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned...."
"For the little ones Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
For the money it can't be beat as a tablet. Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.
For wife - likes it Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
Forgrandkids Grandkids loved it the perfect xmas present for ages 5 to 15
Found what I needed. Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
"Free Tablet Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
"Fun adult toy Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle."
Fun for kids Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
Fun new toy This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.

Fun tablet Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
Fun tablet I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
fun tablet i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play.
Fun tablet for anyone This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
"Fun to play with. If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets."
"Functional Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet."
"Gave as a gift and they love it. Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it."
"Geart tablet My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great"
Geat tablet for everyone So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .

Geeat tablet Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it
"Generally a good tablet The general use for this tablet is only worth for Amazon users mostly so unless your buy and use Amazon products, I don't recommend this to anyone else. The tablet is not excellent compared to others but it is fairly good for an affordable price."
"Get Online without Hassle Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media."
"Gets the job done I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty."
"Gets the job done very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
"Gets the work done I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
Gift Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.
Gift I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.
Gift Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints

Gift Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.
Gift Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.
"gift This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price."
"Gift for 99 year old This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook"
"Gift for Mother In Law This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!"
"Gift for Mother's Day My wife has used a Kindle Fire for years now and it was time to upgrade her. This device went on sale right before Mother's Day and I knew it was time to upgrade her 3 year old device. I picked a color and ordered and delivery to the store and pickup was just in time for the weekend. Overall, great product and great service from Best Buy for getting it to me in time."
Gift for my dad. Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
"Gift for my granddaughter I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!"
Gift for relative. My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.
Gift for wife's Mother We purchased this for my wife's mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading.
"Gifted this tablet to my Dad My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
give for my granddaughter and she seems happy It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
goes off I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
"Good About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good"
good best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!
good bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
Good good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad
Good Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
Good I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear.
Good I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.
Good I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount

Good I use it everyday after work for down time.........
Good It is an amazon amazing among many things that can be used by many people and always will be a good product to use for many people to tryout and have an important experience for their family. Amazon Kindle fire 16gb with side that has slot for the extra memory in the form of a memory chip.
good It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use.
Good It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks
Good Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down.

good nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
Good Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen
Good Thank..............................................
Good This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
Good - But could be much better. Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.

Good affordable tablet You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
Good Alexa device Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
"Good android tablet Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
Good Back Up Tablet For what it does it's great for me a good alternative
Good bargain tablet Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
Good basic protection Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend
Good basic tablet It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
Good basic tablet Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
Good basic tablet Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
good basic tablet and excellent price Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
"Good battery We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
"Good Budget Tablet I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device."
"Good budget tablet It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
"Good budget tablet It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
Good but could be better This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.
Good but... At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
Good buy Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.
good buy got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him.
Good buy Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
Good Buy Great product for surfing the internet or reading books!
Good Buy I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
Good buy for a child or novice user Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles
Good buy for the money I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
"Good buy for the price I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
Good Buy! The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
"Good cheap tablet Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot."
Good cheap tablet This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music.
Good choice for my kids This is a very good product my kids do homework on it
"Good deal Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
Good Deal Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
Good device for beginners I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
Good device. I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights
"Good family tablet Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed."
Good for a child I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
Good for beginners I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
"Good for games and books The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money."
Good for general use Like that I can send and receive e-mails and do general office work and use for pleasure and research.
good for its range its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
"Good for kids Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
"Good for Kids I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
Good for kids I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
Good for Kids This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
Good for me The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
"Good for movies and amazon Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
"Good for movies and amazon Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
Good for price Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
Good for price Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.
Good for price Great graphics for price compared to other brands.
good for price It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.
good for price ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
"Good for price Purchased for 8 yr old daughter. It's easy for her to use and allows me to set time limits on her game, internet and streaming."
Good for price. I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
"Good for reading I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
"Good for reading and audio books. I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price."
Good for the books. Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
"Good for the grandkids I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!"
"Good for the money Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable...."
Good for the money Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
Good for the price Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
"Good for the price I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
Good for the price It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
"Good for the price It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
"Good for the price Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
Good for the price Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
Good for the price So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
Good for watching streaming stuff Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could've been better if there was a mirroring capability.
"Good for what I use it for I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
Good for what I use it for It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
good for Wifi finatic kids I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
"Good gift Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
"Good hardware, bad software The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
"Good ipad alternative Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
Good Item My mom loves this More space and functions very well!
Good item. The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.
"Good lightweight Tablet I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
"Good little tablet with HD quality I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features."
Good low budget Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
"Good low cost option for tablet Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
Good low level tablet good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
Good media consumption device Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.
"Good Option Among Value Tablets I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old."
Good overall tablet This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
Good pad for a beginner Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app.
"Good pad for places not for IPad Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won't let you play it"
Good parental controls for a 5 year old. Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
Good Price Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
good price For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
"Good Price For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
"Good price Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great!"
"good price for the tablet the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
Good price. This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.
good product Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
good product good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas
Good product Good product if you don't want to spend money on iPad. Great just for surfing internet.
Good product Good product with best price available in the market place
Good product Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
Good product I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.

Good product I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
Good product It was great product. the price which I got it was great.
Good product This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.
good product This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading
good product This is my third Kindle Fire. It works beautifully. The only problem I have is little details that are different from previous model. (I'm getting used to it!) As I go I'm learning.....
"Good Product at a Great Purchase Price Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don't like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory."
"good product for kids Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"

Good product for price Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
good product for the money Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
Good product. Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.
Good Product. Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
"good quality good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
"good quality good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
good quality for school Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
"good quality of all apps My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
Good reader I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.
"Good Reader with Internet benefits I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
Good Replacement for Ipad One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
"Good size We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
Good starter tablet Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
Good tablet Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it
good tablet Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
"Good tablet Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
Good tablet Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
Good tablet Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.
"Good tablet Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
"Good Tablet Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
good tablet I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.
Good Tablet My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.
"Good tablet Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use."
good tablet performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
Good tablet Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
Good tablet So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
Good tablet Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
"Good tablet The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use."
Good tablet The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
"Good tablet This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
Good Tablet This is a good basic tablet. It does every thing it is advertised well. Great if your a real amazon fan.
Good tablet This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal.
good tablet We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.
Good tablet Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
"Good tablet and was very skeptical, great choice We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids."
Good tablet at a great price. If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
"Good tablet bad wifi connection This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
"Good tablet for a good price I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use."
"Good tablet for a senior. Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games."
Good tablet for basic needs Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
"Good tablet for basic use. The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
"Good Tablet for Books Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
"Good tablet for browsing, streaming, reading Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
"Good tablet for kids Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost"
"Good tablet for reading and watching videos I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
Good tablet for the average person. I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
Good tablet for the average person. I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
Good tablet for the money Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
"Good tablet for the money My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
"Good tablet for the price Got this for my wife for reading Kindle and ordering on Amazon. It is a nice unit, has quick response time and was a good value."
"Good tablet for the price I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
Good tablet for the price I've had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge.
Good tablet for the price This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix
good tablet for the price. this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
"Good tablet for the price. This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
Good tablet for under $100 This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don't want to spend more on tablets.
"Good tablet for what it does Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
Good tablet for what it's designed to do Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
"Good Tablet, Good Value This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value."
"Good tablet, great battery life If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
"Good tablet! Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
Good tablet. Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.
"Good tablet. Not great, but good. I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."

Good tablets for kids We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
Good Tool The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.
Good Tv Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
"Good upgrade for Kindle This is a nice basic tablet for those not wanting to spend a lot of $$. Easy to use, nice HD resolution for games and even watching Netflix etc."
good upgrade from my old kindle Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
Good value Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.
"Good value Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
Good Value I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
"Good value Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
"Good Value The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
Good Value This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right.
"Good value Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa"
"Good value and Samsung quality! Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn't as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else."
good value for kindle fire hd 8 Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful
Good value for the price For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
"Good value for what you get First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus."
"Good, not great Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying."
Good!!! I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
"Good.... so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
Got as a gift Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?

Great I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
Great I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one
Great It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it
Great It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
Great It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.
Great It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web
Great It's works really well and don't have any issues at all
Great Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.

Great My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase.
Great Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.
"Great Ordered it for a friend so that he could do his bible study, n play games n read books . He loves it"
"Great Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight."
great The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
"Great The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
great the recipient of this gift was very happy to receive it. worked great
great This is a very responsive device for the amount paid
Great This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.
Great Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
great Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
"Great 8"" tablet!! Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
"Great addition I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
"Great Alternative to College Textbooks I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
"Great alternative to expensive tablets I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product."
Great alternative to iPad Mini Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members
"great Amazon device If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"

"Great Amazon tablet I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
"Great Amazon Tablet It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
"Great Amazon Tablet Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc."
"Great and easy to use I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!"
Great and light weight!! Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
Great and lightweight reader I love ordering books and reading them with the reader.
Great and versatile Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
"Great android tablet With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time."
Great as a gift they love it better than paper bac This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books
"Great as a tablet and E-reader Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
Great as ereader I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
"Great Bang for the Buck Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
Great bang for your buck Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.
"Great bang for your buck Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone."
"Great bargain Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
Great Bargain Tablet I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet.
"Great bargain tablet. Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!"
Great basic tab Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
Great basic tablet Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
Great basic tablet This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
"Great basic tablet, best with Prime subscription Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
Great beginner tablet My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math.
Great beginners tablet My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
Great birthday gift Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.
"Great black friday price for this tablet I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
"great book reader this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range"
Great budget tablet Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
Great budget tablet Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
Great budget tablet Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.
Great budget tablet The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7.
"Great Budget Tablet This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
Great budget tablet This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
"Great budget tabley This is a Great budget table, it has has Great features for the price"
Great buy Best bang for your buck............................
Great buy Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great Buy I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.
"Great Buy i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics"
"Great Buy I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
"Great buy If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else."
great buy it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
great buy it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
Great Buy Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.
Great buy My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.
"Great buy Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
Great buy Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad

"Great Buy Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue."
Great Buy We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing.
great buy and easy to use I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use.
GREAT BUY FOR MY GRANDSON I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
Great buy for the price Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy!
"Great buy for the price! I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet!"
Great buy! Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus
Great buy! I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it!
"Great buy! I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7"" for my wife that afternoon!"
Great buy! I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.
"Great buy! It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating."
Great buy! less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!
"Great cable, esp. for price Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone ""barrows"" a cable."
"Great cheap tablet Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too."
Great Children Tablets They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
Great Choice All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!

"great Christmas gift Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it."
Great Christmas Gift We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
Great deal Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet
"Great deal Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
Great deal I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point.
Great deal Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world.
Great deal Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.
"Great deal on a great tablet This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered."
Great deal thanks I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!

"Great Device Better then a E-book, more options and versatility"
Great device Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down
"Great Device Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break."
Great Device Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews.
Great Device I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
Great device I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
"Great device The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you."
Great device This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
"Great device This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!"
Great device This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has
"Great device This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc"
Great device for my sons games This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
"Great device for the price Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload."
"Great Device for What It Is Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
"Great device for young children who love to read Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend"
Great Device! I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!

Great E Reader This kindle is very convenient and has a great display that's easy on the eyes.
"Great E-reader This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
"Great e-reader and basic color tablet Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable."
Great e-reader. Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
"great ebook the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended"
Great ebook reader Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
"Great entry level tablet If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!"
Great ereader I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.

Great ereader + This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.
"Great ereader and tablet I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
Great every day tablet This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
Great everyday tablet!! Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
"Great features and affordable I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!"
"Great features! The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
great fire amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
Great Fire Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do.
Great Fire Tablet My kids have gone through several Amazon Tablets and this one is by-far the best one I have seen.
Great fire tablet Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.

I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least."
Great for 9 year old grandson This tablet is for our 9 year old grandson. It works out great for him to play games on.
Great for a beginner I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too.
great for a beginner Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
Great for a first time user It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on
"Great for Amazon-related activities I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned."
Great for an ereader This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.
Great for anyone. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
"Great For Basic To Moderate Use I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
great for bebinners into 21st century perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in
Great for beginner I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps
Great for beginner My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it.
Great for beginners I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
Great for book lovers I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!
"Great for Books and Alexa feature is nice I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch"
Great for books and as a tablet Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one.
"Great for child use Bought for grandson ,he loves it's! He uses it daily after home work done."
Great for children My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available.
Great for college Small enough for a purse and works great. I would recommend memory card.
Great for college students We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents.
"Great for consuming content This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
"Great for day to day use I bought this for my sister after her child stepped on her laptop and broke the screen! She is in love with it - it's just the right size for her to do her photo editing, surf the web, watch videos, etc. It's quite durable as well - seeing as how a four-year-old has his hands on it quite often :)The only thing that could be improved is the camera quality - but we didn't buy it to take pictures with. Just to edit them!"
great for e reader and email I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.
"Great for ebooks for school. So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this."
"Great for entertainment Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."
"Great for entertainment & e-mail This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it‚Äôs great for entertainment."
Great for every day use I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.
Great for everyone - not just the avid reader Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!

"Great for kids Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips"
"Great for kids For the price you can't beat this tablet for kids. I'm not a fan of Amazon's super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can't access the tablet without your permission."

Great for Kids or Adults Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!!
"Great for kids! We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."

Great for my 11 year old daughter Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there.

GREAT FOR READING BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE
"Great for reading Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!"
"Great for reading I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd."
Great for reading Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it.
Great for reading Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.
Great for reading So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book
Great for reading This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies!

"Great for tablet for kids This is our 4th kindle and we love them as ""beginner"" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue!"

Great for the $$$ Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet.
"Great for the Grandkids Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved ."
"Great for the grandkids Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available."
great for the kids I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids
great for the money I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.
Great for the new user. Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
"Great for the price At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
Great for the price Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good.
"great for the price great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either"
Great for the price I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
"great for the price I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
Great for the price Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
Great for the price No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
"Great for the Price The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
Great for the price! Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.
"Great for travel Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc."

"Great for what it does! When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!"

Great for your Prime access I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.
"Great fun,Educational apps,books,brain teasers Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
Great gaming device This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
"Great general tablet choice Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features."
"Great gift A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT!"
"Great gift I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!"
Great gift My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life

Great gift for my kids I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.

Great gift for readers Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!
Great gift idea Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family.

Great improvement over earlier Kindle Fire I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.
"Great inexpensive tablet Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again."
Great inexpensive tablet I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.

"Great inexpensive tablet Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."

"Great ipad for a beginner such as I am It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."

Great kindle Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her.
"Great Kindle I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate."
Great Kindle I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!
Great kindle I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3.

Great Kindle for reading Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
Great Kindle. I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.
Great Kindle/Tablet I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.
"Great little device Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv."
Great little device Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
great little device fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
"Great little notebook. No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well."
Great little reader It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.
"Great Little Tablet I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
"Great little tablet It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
Great little Tablet Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !
Great little tablet Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.

great pad for both children and adults Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.

Great price on a nice tablet The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it.
"Great price on an awesome little tablet I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."

Great Tablet I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.

"Great tablet This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)"

"great tablet and price I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8"" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too."
"Great tablet at a good price Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot."
Great tablet at a great price This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
Great tablet at a great price! Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
Great tablet but not for everything Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.
Great tablet compared to a small phone screen The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.

But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube."

"Great tablet for kids! We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
"Great tablet for low price Perfect if you're looking for the basic necessities of a laptop. Only negatives no yahoo apps, no google apps, no apple app, but it's still awesome."
Great tablet for me I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.

Great tablet for normal use I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It's fast and easy to use.
"Great Tablet for novice The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video."
Great tablet for price Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.
Great tablet for price Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
"Great tablet for price The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."

great tablet for teenagers Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody.
"Great tablet for the $ I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price."
"Great tablet for the $$ Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand."
Great Tablet for the casual user A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.

"Great tablet for the price Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games."

Great tablet for the price It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
Great tablet for the price Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
"great tablet for the price My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."
"Great tablet for the price My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it."
Great tablet for the price Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
Great tablet for the price Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.
Great tablet for the price Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
great tablet for the price Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!
"Great tablet for the price The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
"Great tablet for the price The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it)."

Great tablet for the price You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
"great tablet for the price and easy to operate this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera"
"Great tablet for the price paid I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience."
"Great tablet for the price! My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable."
"Great tablet for the price! Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!"
"Great tablet for the price. A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled."
"Great tablet for the price. For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve."
Great tablet for the price. Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
Great tablet for the price. I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.

"Great tablet for the price. Love it! This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
Great tablet for the size We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.

Great tablet to start Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house.
great tablet very durable I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
"Great tablet with caveats I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."
"Great Tablet with Fire OS This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases!"
"Great Tablet with lots of functionality. I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."

"Great tablet, only problem.. I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
"Great tablet, right size Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
"Great Tablet, unbelievable price I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!"
"Great Tablet! Bought this during black friday for $60. while I'm skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price!"

Great Tablet!!! I love my new Fire HD and it takes great photos! It has a nice size screen but is compact enough to fit in my purse.
Great tablet. Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
"Great tablet. I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
Great tablet. I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
Great tablet. I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.

"Great Tablets We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year."
Great Teenage Gift Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
Great to stream movies I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym
Great to travel with Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
Great to use on go Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
"Great to use with hand injury I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"

Great update to my existing kindle Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one
"Great updated Kindle I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
"Great upgrade I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
"Great upgrade Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia""."
Great Upgrade Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.
Great use of my dollars Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle
"Great Value Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
GREAT VALUE BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
Great Value Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
"Great Value Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
"Great value Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing."
Great value I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.
"Great Value I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great."
"Great Value I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself."

GREAT VALUE PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.
great value serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
"Great Value Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores."
GREAT VALUE The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
"Great value This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime."
Great Value Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
Great value Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
Great Value Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift
Great value Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds.
"Great Value You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it."
Great Value after additions Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
"Great value and well Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
Great value for price Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
Great value for pricing Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
Great value for the money. Fast processor as well Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.
"Great value for what you get It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
"Great value tablet!! Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
"Great value, performance for the price Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights."
"Great value! For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase."
Great work giveaway item Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it

"Great working tablet for the price The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness."
"Great xmas gift My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time."
"Great, but awaiting Alexa feature Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
"Great, easy to use tablet Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
"Great, quality tablet Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
"Great, simple, and resonably priced tablet. Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend"
Great! Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
Great! Bought this for my sister. This has replaced her I Pad. She loves it.
Great! Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it!
Great! Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!
Great! Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
Great! Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
Great! Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.
Great! This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
Great! Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
"Great!! I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!!"
Great!!!! Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
"Great!!!! This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged."
"Great. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."

Great. Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.
Great. Easy to set up and use! Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
Great. Simple easy to use Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag.
"greatest tablet at this price point great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
"Grest tablet Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around"
"Gret device This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc."
"Had one already, like it. Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild."
Handy Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
Handy and fun. I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
"Happier than I expected I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
Happy My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use
Happy & Satisfied Customer I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice.
Happy customer Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.
Happy Wife Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day
"happy with Amazon tablet very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
Happy with this purchase I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
"Hard to beat for the price! This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
"Hard to beat value Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead."
Hard to set up I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
"Has everything you need This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
Has potential. I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
"hate it not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
"Have a nook, this is better has more apps and go Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
Haven't set it up yet It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.
"HD Fire8 I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use."
"HD makes big difference I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."

Hd tablet This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
hey its a tablet great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
Hi Def is great and speed better than the past I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.
"Ho-hum! It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person."
"horrible Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless"
Husband's Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
I I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
I am a Kindle lover. This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it.
I am impressed with the Kindle Fire HD. The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
I am trying to know more about it. I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
I bought one for me and one for each of my nieces. I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
I bought the Kindle FireHD for a beginner I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.
"I cherish my kindle it's my window to the world. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
"I cherish my kindle it's my window to the world. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
I have 3 kindle fires I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
I like I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
I like it I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
I like it! I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
I like my kindle fire This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.
I like the Kindle Fire very much. My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
I like the screen size and the camera. The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.
"i love ‚ù§ tablet I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017"
"i love ‚ù§ tablet I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017"
I love it I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
I love it It's definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have
I love it Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price
"I love it! I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!"
"I Love It! The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn."
I love it!! Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.
i love it!!! i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!
I love my Kindle The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
I love my kindle ! The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
I love my Kindle! The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
"I love my kindle......best investment I have made I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
"I love my kindles I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc"
I love my new tablet ! This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !
I love these Kindles so much My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them
I love this product. I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.
I love this tablet! Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.
I LOVE this tablet. I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
"I love this thing. This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will."
"I think better than kindle paperweight This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
I use my Kindle every day. This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.
I was expecting more It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.

"I would buy it again I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
I'd buy again Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
I'd give it a 10 star rating! Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
I'm happy with it Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
"I'M NEW AT THIS I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
I'm very happy with my kindle hd8 I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
Images I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others
Impressive for kids A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
In love! I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
"In love! I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
"IN MY VIEW, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST READING TABLET GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
"IN MY VIEW, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST READING TABLET GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
Inexpensive One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
"Inexpensive - works for me I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well."
"Inexpensive, yet Great quality tablet I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
"iPad ""lite"" This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there."
iPod nano I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.
"It fits my need perfectly My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
It Has Alexa Built In! Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
"It is a great product! The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
It is a great tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grand It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.
"It is a shopping device If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
It is amazing Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
"It is just what I was looking for. I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted."
It nice We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
It was a good buy It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
It was everything I was looking for. Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.

It was good The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone
It was purchased as a gift. My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.
"It works and charge well No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
It's a great item that I purchased as a Christmas. I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
It's all most people need Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
"It's an ok tablet for the price. In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."

"It's an ok tablet, but very limited in apps. I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode."
It's easy to use My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
It's fair Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
It's fast and perfect I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better
It's great I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
"It's great, I love it! I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions."
It's neato It's nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug.
It's nice and whatever Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.
it's ok my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
"It's pretty average for what you are paying I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
Its a good small tablet This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
"Its an ok tablet. My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults."
Its great! Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it
"Its not an android, but it'll do Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50."
"Its perfect for my 9 year old There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
"jealous I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one."
"Just as expected I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!"
Just as expected This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it's just as advertised.
Just decent tablet Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...
Just fun for everyone. Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
Just ok It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
"Just ok for the price This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed."
just right for me it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
Just the right price I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
"Just what I wanted I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
"Just wish. . . I had known Amazon was going to release the next Generation a few weeks after I bought this one! OTOH, my wife is happy with it. It just offended my geek side. However, it has Alexa and integrates well with my Philips Hue equipment."
Keeps the wife happy and thus me as well Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.
kid friendly Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
Kid loved it This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
Kids gift for Xmas She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
Kids love Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around.
"Kids love it Great for kids, my kids haven't stopped playing with it"
"kids love it Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate."
Kids present Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.
Kids tablet Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
Kindle great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.
Kindle I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.
Kindle This is really nice and has great clarity I like it.
Kindle This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
"Kindle 8 I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
"Kindle 8"" Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase."
Kindle baby This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours.
Kindle Fan Wish I could download Google Docs but otherwise very happy with my kindle fire.
Kindle Fire Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
Kindle Fire I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it.
Kindle fire I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me
Kindle fire I love the quality and ease of using the kindle fire. I will like to purchase more for my family for xmas.
Kindle fire I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up!
Kindle fire Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.
"Kindle Fire My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect."
Kindle fire This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!
"KINDLE FIRE This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
Kindle Fire We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen.
"Kindle Fire 8 I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this."
Kindle fire 8 Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks
Kindle fire 8 Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
Kindle Fire 8HD I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!
"Kindle Fire Exceeds Expectations Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email."
"Kindle fire hd My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
"Kindle Fire HD 8 These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well."
Kindle Fire HD 8 This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
Kindle fire hd 8th generation I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
"Kindle Fire HD Just OK I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
Kindle Fire HD8 Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate.
Kindle Fire HD8 This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.
"Kindle fire hd8 This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
kindle fire hd8 2016 outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
"Kindle Fire is a great size for travel. I use my Fire every day. I'm very satisfied with it's performance and size. The battery last a long time, so I can use the Kindle for hours without recharging."
Kindle Fire is best bang for buck Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability.
"Kindle Fire is great for reading New Kindle Fire 8 is easy to setup, great for reading, no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network. I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet."
Kindle fire rocks Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
kindle hd love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.
"Kindle Reading I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books...."
Kindle to Fire I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
Kindle upgrade Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
"Kindle with a lot of advertising I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
"Kindle/Amazon Fire I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!"
Kindles are great for traveling. Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights.
Late gift for my grandson Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).
less cumbersome This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
"less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast! Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"

Lifelike screen This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you.
light and compact i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
Lightweight and sleek For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
"Lightweight, easy to use tablet I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
"Like a laptop, only smaller I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
LIKE IT I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.
Like our Kindle Fire Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.

I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately.

"Love the Amazon Fire Hd8 I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time."
Love the apps. Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.
Love the changes from the old kindle fires Would recommend this to others better than kindle fires of best
Love the Fire We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.

Love the Tablet I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
love this for games My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!
Love this Kindle Fire Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.

Love this tablet Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
"Love this tablet Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,"
"Love this tablet! I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
Love this tablet! I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!
Love this tablet. Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.
Love using Kindle Fire Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
"Love, love, love, it This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one"
"Love, loved it, but I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you."
"Loving it! Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
Loving it! I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can't do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product.
Loving it! I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!
"Low budget tab I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it."
Low cost tablet that works well This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
"Low cost, effective, internet device I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device."
Luv this Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
Luv this Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
Machine meets all expectations I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
Makes a great Christmas present Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around
"Makes a great gift for first time Tablet Users I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
Maybe Best Fire Yet for $89 Just picked up from BB a couple of hours ago. Screen in good and tablet seems faster than previous model possibly due to more memory. Battery so far seems very good.
Mom Loves it Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
Mom Loves it Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
"Mom's Firestick As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
"More capabilities than I was expecting... Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available."
More ideal for a child or teen. This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
"More options, more problems I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price."
"most for the money I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK."
Mother's Day Gift I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.
Mr Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
"Much better This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
"Much better than Fire 7"", for slightly more money Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books."
Much quicker than previous model I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.
Multi- functional Great screen clarity and rapid turn on.All function you need in a transportable tablet
"Multi-Function Tablet Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"

Must have tablet! Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
"my 7-year-old loves it I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price."
My daughter in law loved it! Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!

"My son likes it This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok"

My son really enjoys it. My son really likes the larger screen to play games.
My tablet won't hold a charge I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`
My wife and I really enjoy our kindle fire HD8 We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.
"My wife loves it! This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
My wife loves this Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!
My wife loves this Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.
"Need guide/instructions When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
"Need more Apps It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally."
Needed something to read books This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.
Needed the bigger tablet. I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
"Nephew Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music."
"net surfing on a budget What you think you need more than a Kindle to surf the web? You don't. Cheap and effective. Plus it's an alarm clock too, plus with the right apps it's a radio, what's that you say a clock/radio? You know it hipsters."
New and improved kindle Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
New and improved Kindle Fire! Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!
"New fireHD8 I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading."
New kindle I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
"New toys! I haven't had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I've downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money."
New vs older movied My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile.
Newer & better Kindle Fire I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!

Nice and fast Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.
nice and lightweight Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far
Nice basic tablet It's a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get

Nice for the price Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities
Nice for the price If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.

nice improvments the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great
nice in a price the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
Nice Kindle Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
"Nice little tablet for the price Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
"Nice lower priced tablet For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
Nice pad Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
Nice product Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.
nice product Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.

nice product for the money PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
"Nice product, love the screen size Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one."
Nice reader with backlit display i upgraded from an older kindle that wasn't backlit. The quality and ease of use is much better and I love the backlit feature!
"Nice screen resolution. Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
Nice set of headphones Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend.
"Nice size Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
"nice small tablet I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it"
nice small tablet the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire
Nice tablet Awesome good size large enough for games and photos

"Nice tablet Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price"
Nice tablet Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free

Nice Tablet Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
Nice tablet This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.
"Nice tablet Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
Nice tablet at a great price! Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate.
"Nice tablet for 6 year old Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
Nice tablet for amazon users Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.
Nice tablet for books and videos An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!
"nice tablet for everydayuse love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues"
Nice tablet for my GF This is a very nice tablet for my GF who has never had one before.
Nice Tablet for the Money This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.
Nice Tablet for the Price I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
nice tablet for the price Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.
"Nice tablet for the price. Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading."
"Nice tablet for the price. I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
Nice tablet for the price. This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it.
Nice tablet for the price. This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
"Nice tablet, fantastic value There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding."
"Nice tablet, great price. My husband's previous tablet died a sudden death, so I gave it back and bought this FIRE. The sound volume and quality is much better."
"Nice tablet, little slow Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
"Nice tablet, simple to use Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet"
"Nice tablet! I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too."
Nice travel companion Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
"nice tv needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us"
"Nice unit. Good price. I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer."
Nice upgrade Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
"Nice Upgrade This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password."
nice upgrade Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps.
"Nice upgrade from 7"" Amazon Tablet Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket"
"Nice, convenient Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy."
Nice! Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good.
Nice! Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
Nice!! Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games!
Nice. Hoping it keeps charge. I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
Nicely priced beginner tablet. While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
"No Android support This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money."
No Complaints This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..
No complaints here Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
"No Flashy, does it's job. Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device."
non functional!!! horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
"Not ad happy with this one by far I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
Not bad Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth.
"Not bad This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
"Not bad for $60 BF Deal This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
"not bad, but... I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
Not charging well Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
"Not fancy, but it will get the job done While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."
Not for computer beginner Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
"Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
"Not like the older model Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
Not looking too good... I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.

"Not Perfect, but Very Good Bought as a Mother's Day Gift. This is great for someone who does not already have a tablet, and is a bit uncomfortable with technology. The tablet guides you pretty well, and once we had it setup with OverDrive, the recipient was very happy. FREE LIBRARY KINDLE BOOKS!"
Not really statisfied with features Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it
Not so good! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!

Not so much Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
"not the best in class but priced right This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase."
"Not what I expected I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading."
"NOT WORTH IT I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
"Now do not have to carry around a laptop. This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"Now do not have to carry around a laptop. This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"Oh my LAWD Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!"
ok bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
Ok I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations
"Ok for a young person I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
"Ok for Basics Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet."
Ok for the price Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
Ok for the price The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
Ok tablet I'm used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate
Okay for a small tablet Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
"Okay Tablet The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
"Okay, but not the best It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use."
okkkkkk ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok
OMG I LOVE THIS FIRE Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
"One flaw Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
"One of my best ""Best Buy"" prurchases! Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications."
One of the best Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.
One of the best fire tablets I've purchased so far Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
Only downside is it's not a phone Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it's a bargain
Outstanding Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
Outstanding quality; great value My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.
"Outstanding replacement for original Kindle Fire The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8"" vs. 7"") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors."
Outstanding speed I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.
"Outstanding value! I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
"Overall a good tablet for the money Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value."
"overall good product,bright color screen. my 7"" wore out,my 8"" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !"
"Overall great But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
"Overall great But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
Overall great prodcut Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
"Overall great product Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
Overall great sound & screen quality. The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
Overall has great functionality! The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.
Overall nice display; email setup not so friendly Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.

Perfect for what I wanted it for. It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.

"Perfect gift My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great."
Perfect Gift My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
Perfect gift We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
Perfect gift! Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price!
"Perfect kindle I enjoy using this Kindle fire 8"". The apps are easy to install, the screen is a great size. I can even use it without my glasses."
"Perfect Lightweight Tablet My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy!"
Perfect purchase My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.
"Perfect Size After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use."
Perfect size Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
Perfect size The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
"Perfect size for daily use, good battery life After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet."
Perfect size screen for easy viewing This product is easy to use and take along with you
"Perfect size. Great resolution. Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze."
Perfect step up My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos.
Perfect step up from a kindle Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)
Perfect tablet Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
Perfect tablet for a beginner This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.
Perfect tablet for books We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
"Perfect tablet for young children We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied."
Perfect Value Ordered one for my daughter. It's the fourth Kindle we have bought and love them. Perfect for watching videos and movies.
PERFECT! I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
PERFECT! We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!
Perfect.price Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.
picked one up for fun and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
"Pleasanty Surprised I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption."
Pleased This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
poor photo quality Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
Poor quality tablet I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
powerful small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
"Powerful tablet Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money"
"Powerful, but not easy to use Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
Prefer it to the Nook I had Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.
Present for grandpa Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
Present for my daughter & she loves it! My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
Presents for a 5 year old and a 9 year old These two boys were thrilled with the Fire tablet. Every time I see them they are glued to the tablet. They both have said it is the best present EVER. Extra points to the grandfather on these gifts!
Pretty Decent This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
Pretty good The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment
"Pretty good... This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
Pretty great tablet for price Great tablet great screen built well responds well
Pretty nice Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
Pretty nice. Light weight I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
"Price was right I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
"Priced to sell, nice little unit! Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!"
Product Review This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
Purchased as a Christmas Gift The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
Purchased as a gift I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
Purchased as a gift Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.
"Purchased for Mother as a present And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started."
Purchased to replace my iPad I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago.
"Quality Product at Great Price The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
"Quality upgrade for Fire users This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
Quick and responsive without the Apple price tag If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you...
"quick delivery, great price still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too."
"Quit charging I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging."
Reader I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline. Great price.
Readers delight I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!
reading is enjoyable and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot.
Reading lover My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!
Ready to use feature is amazing Being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up makes this device super user friendly!
"Really decent tablet This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends!"
"Really good picture Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link"
Really great quality I really like the price and quality of the product
Really like for reading books at Lunch My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.

Really love my new Kindle. Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.
recommended by a friend. It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
Repeat purchaser This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
Replace a tablet Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
Replacement for Nabi This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
"Replacement for non-working ""old"" Kindle Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games."
"Replacement purchase Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!"
"Replacing older 7"" Amazon Fire I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet."
Replacing the Original Kindle E-Reader My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!!
Returned I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
returned item Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
Right size The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift.
Sad It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
"Satisfied For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic."
"Satisfied Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet."
"Second Kindle This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend."
"Second Kindle For My Son We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
"Serves my tablet needs perfectly For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
short life Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
should have purchased sooner For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
"Simple and nice! I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it's purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don't need them so I don't use them and it's not a big deal for me."
"Simple Tablet, Great Features This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture."
Size and price good. Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
Small And Compact This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
smiles bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
"Snappy, value tablet This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing"
So convenient and easy to use!! Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
"So far I love it! After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking."
"So far so good I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
So Far So Good Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory.
"So far so good This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
So far so good This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up
So far so good.. So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.

"so fast I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
So great I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
So very happy with the new kindle ! So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !
"solid tablet bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features..."
"Solid tablet for the price For the price, it's tough to get a better tablet than the Kindle Fire. It's not the same quality as higher priced tablets, and you're locked into Amazon's ecosystem, but if you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet, the Kindle Fire is a good choice."
Solid tablet! This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
"some improvements over my earlier version This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don't have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor's or dentist's office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.."
Son loves it Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
soso works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.
"Space saver Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device."
"Splendid Reader Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased."
"Step up from fire6 My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which."
"Still figuring it out still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
Still having problems with my camera figuring it o I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
"Still prefer iPad or android tablet Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
stopped working after 3 weeks. the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
Students will love this! I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
Super fast tablet love it! Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
super item This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.
"Super Nice Tablet I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one."
Super present Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
Super tablet for the price Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
"Super User Friendly I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product."
Superfast This newest version of Fire works great! Responds fast to opening apps and speed of browser is quick. The color choices are nice too!
Surprisingly GOOD I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
Surprisingly good Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.
Sweet tablet The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
Tab Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone

Tablet for the kiddo Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.

"Tablet nice, not so nice battery though Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging"
"Tablet works pretty good, just getting started. I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
Tablethe Review Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price.
"techy kids will like great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
Teenagers love it! Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
Terrible I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.

"TERRIBLE DONT BUY i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
Terrific Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.
Terrific tablet for its size. Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
"Terrific Tablet! Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."

The Amazon fire is the perfect size I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you
"The best !!! I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money."
The best tablet! Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well.
The camera is awful! Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
"The Definition of Value This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!"
The Fire is good for the price I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
the first Fire HD8 we purchased died The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
"The Kindle Fire 8 is awesome! I purchased the Kindle Fire 8"" after owning a 7"" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version."
The kindle fire HD 8 is really great! It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast!
The perfect reader The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
The Perfect Tablet I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
"They are Christmas presents Excellent value for small laptops. Lenovo 11.2"" screens with flash memory & Microsoft Word for 1 year."
"Think it is a good product It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
This Fire works great for the person I gave it to. I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!!
"This is a great size for commuting This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly!"
"this is a great tablet i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
This is a very good lower priced tablet This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc.
"this is amazing, i love it i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime"
this is great for reading books works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well
This is my 4th one. Love them My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome.
This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price.
This is the clearest screen ive ever seen this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
"This is the third Kindle I have purchased. Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money."
"This is very convenient It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price"
"this product has great features, and good history the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
"This Product Is On Fire!! I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: ""A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone!"
"This tablet its awesome !!!! My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!!"
"This tablet was nice, but... I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!"
tons of limitations I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....
"Too good to pass up! I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
Too many ads This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
Too many Amazon amps Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use.
"Too may preloaded useless apps This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
"Too slow for browsing I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
Unable to use it I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
"Unexpected Tablet I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."

upgrade awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire
Upgrade from fire 7HD The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!
"Upgraded from the original fire, glad I did! I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal!"
"Use my kindle 8 more than my laptop! I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
"Useful aid The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge."
User friendly Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
User friendly Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
Value for money! Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
"Value for money. Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
"Very basic Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old."
"Very basic and cheap tablet You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab."
"Very competent tablet for the price. I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration."
"Very competitive with iPad to the touch Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet."
Very Cool for teen My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
"Very descent Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
Very easy tablet to use This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
very easy to use We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value
"Very easy to use. This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
very fast great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
"Very functional tablet Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners."
Very good Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I'm traveling!!
Very Good It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
Very good Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.
Very good Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
"Very good for reading, email, internet Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,"
Very good for the price. Does exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend for an inexpensive travel reader.
Very Good Product This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great.
Very good product Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.

"Very good product so far Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price"
"very good quality for the $ Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
"very good tablet Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi."
"Very Good Tablet Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."

"Very Good tablet Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
"Very good tablet and best price Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
Very Good Tablet for the Money I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
Very happy Bought this as a gift for my mom and couldn't be more pleased at how she is enjoying it.
very happy this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
Very happy Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
Very happy Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
"Very Happy Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
"Very happy with Tablet First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good!"
Very happy with this purchase Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
"Very happy. Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones."
"Very limited capabilities. Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found."
"Very nice I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee"
"Very Nice The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7."
Very nice This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
Very nice This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
Very nice Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
"very nice surprise I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
"Very nice tablet I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the ""educational"" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself."
"Very nice tablet I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
"Very nice tablet This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones."
Very nice tablet for the money This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.
"very nice tablet for the price The new tablet is great ÔºÅ nice upgradesÔºÅLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web."
Very nice tablett I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
"Very nice, east for child Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly!"
"VERY parent friendly! VERY parent friendly! Extremely thorough parental controls. We were told at the store there was no way to block internet or control other content on a tablet, so we decided not to get one. Then, we read about the integrated parental controls with the Fire and gave it a try. It allowed us to do everything we wanted and more. Also, very easy set up and use!"
Very pleased with tablet Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.
"Very pleased with tablet! The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
Very poor. Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
Very useful for the low cost Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
"Very useful in reading and in using the internet. I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics."
Very user friendly for beginner Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
"Very user friendly! Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person."
"very userfriendly The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful"
"Very versatile tablet. I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
Very versatile. This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
Wanted it for pictures to show and it works great. It is better than we expected and couldn't be happier.
"Was a gift Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
"Was for my wife who loves it This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
Was misled on price match. Item is okay. Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don't do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay.
Wasn't for me Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
Waste of money Slow response. Wait 5 sec to turn a page. Frustrating. Best Buy says too bad so sad for me.
We purchased for our 8 year old who loves tablets We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
Weak wifi The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering.
"Well improved Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well"
well worth it i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great.
"Well worth the money! The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn't lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase!"
Well worth the price. I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
"What a deal! This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too."
WHAT CAN I SAY YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
"Wife absolutley loves her new Fire HD 8 tablet Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
wife love it got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
Wife loves brand new Fire tablet Bought a new Fire tablet for my wife for a Mother's Day gift to replace an old tablet. She is fully enjoying the new device and fashionable case. Best Buy staff were very helpful too.
Wife loves it My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.
"Wife Loves it Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
"Wife LOVES it We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range."
"Wife loves it! My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it!"
Wife loves it. This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
"Woks great! Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
"Won't unlock Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
Wonderful I purchased this tablet because of its reputation very satisfied
Wonderful buy for the money spent Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer!
Wonderful product! This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.
"Wonderful starter for a child I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok."
"Wonderful Tablet I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8"" screen. The price was perfect for my budget."
Wonderful Tablet This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup.
Wonderful Tablet for Anyone I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!
Wonderful thus far Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
Works As Advertised! Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!
"Works as Intended. Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself."
"Works exactly as described Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
"Works fine I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
"Works fine so far. Tends to change screens. Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far."
"Works for my applications I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy."
Works good. Easy setup. I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
Works great Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend
"Works great Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it"
Works great Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
Works great Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
Works great Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
"works great it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
Works great Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.
"Works great Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
Works great Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view
Works great Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
"Works great for classes We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals"
Works great for my 6 yr old So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
works great for my dad Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather
"works great, but..... the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
works great. make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.
works grood this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon
"Works just fine. Faster than the old one! It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer."
"Works pretty good for a great price Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos."
"Works quit well - would recommend!! I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!"
"Works So Far This was a replacement for a poorly functioning new purchase of a Kindle 7. Seems to be working fine, but some games loading from Amazon have issues."
"works very well It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news."
Works very well especially for non tech people This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage
"works very well. much better than the old ""fire"" This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good."
works well the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
Works well and was the perfect gift This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.
"Works well but too tied to Amazon. The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
Worlks as advertised Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games
Worth every dime!! I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.
worth having the product to kids this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
Worth it !! The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.
"Would buy again Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy."
"Wow! Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
Xmas gift I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read
yes it is a great tablet. I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.
"You get a lot for the price! Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price."
"You get the entire World for less than $100! This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!"
"You get what your paying for At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
Amazing Amazing way to keep my kids reading and also to have for games
Amazing Got this for my father and he enjoys it. Plus I got it on black friday pricing too
Amazon fire 7 I bought for my son. Bought the thick blue bumper with it. 30 dollars for tablet on Black Friday. I liked it so much that I bought 3 more as Christmas stocking stuffers. He‚Äôs 17 months old and loves it.
Amazon tablet 7 . Grandkids love it The kids loved the tablets. They have many games that they play on their new tablet that they can't play on their other devices because they cost money. Great tablet!
awsome tablets i bought my younger nephews tablets for Christmas they loved them and they were very affordable and they work amazing!
Best kindle yet Easy to download needed apps and programs. Alexa is an amazing addition to kindle. My children absolutely love it.
"Best Price I have one and the grand children always fighting over. Now, they have their own!"
Best product I love the Amazon fire tablets. They are reliable. And I buy them as gifts for loved ones and students; for online learning.
better than expectation price is cheap for big discount. but display size is not big and OS is a bit slow than apple
"Buy a protective cover! This is not the first kindle i buy, but the others were for my kids or gifted to kids so they broke at some point. This one was for me, i didn‚Äôt hurry to buy a cover as i am a veeery careful person. Well i was sorry to see the back (yes, the back) cracked within a month, no drop whatsoever, i keep it on my bedside table to read at night."
Christmas present Kids love it...watch YouTube and Netflix on it...great for streaming
Christmas Present Since it is a Christmas gift it has not been opened yet. I bought it because I liked it as well as the price.
Come on---29.00 An unbelievable deal for a tablet that works better than a 99.00 Samsung. I added a 9.99 32 GB micro card and am all set.
Cool Awsome ................ ....................... ...
Does the job This tablet it will do the job but mostle for games videos YouTube etc is really slow so if you are looking for somthing fas skip this tablet
Does the job... It is definitely not the fastest or the best looking tablet but for $30 is more than enough to browse the web and do some shopping.
dont last more than 1 year It's my 3rd purchase of the amazon Fire. Got extended warranty. So basically getting the next one at 50% off next year
"easy to work with the tablet is very easy to set up, the connection to WFi was very straight forward and works reliably,"

Good for web browsing or little games Its good for a cheap tablet just for checking a website or playing a game like candy crush
"Good inexpensive tablet This was a gift to my husband that did not want the learning challenge. Yet, he loves it now."
Good Price Good cartridge by HP. Like being able to order online and then pick up at the store. Saves me running to the store only to find they might be out.
Good product Definitely got my money worth when I got this product the day after thanksgiving and it was well worth it! My son had a kids kindle so I already knew how to get around it from having to use and set up his. Easy to use. Can‚Äôt load alot of extra and it‚Äôs a tad slower right now due to getting one with a smaller memory but nothing a bigger memory card won‚Äôt solve :)
"Good product Good, fast and responsive. The price is also very reasonable. Great for what I need this tablet for. I use it to stream music to my soundbar."
Good product and good service The product is handy and good. The service is excellent.
Good small tablet for basic use. Easy to set up and start using right away. I connect it to wifi and it works pretty good. Buffers a lot when I walk around with it and am trying to watch a show or something. Phone seems to work better on wifi. But it has good picture quality and a long battery life.
Good tablet This is a pretty good tablet for the price of the tablet
Good tablet for free kids This was a good buy for gifts and very satisfied with quality
Grandkids love it It is a better tablet then the rest better reviews and a good price

Great Black Friday Buy I love this product so far. No issues so far. Will shop again.
"Great Fire 7 for a beginner Love the fire 7, just what I wanted. Great value for the money"
Great for a preschooler I brought it for my 4 year old and she loves it. It's easy to control her settings and the screen size is a plus.
Great for a teenager. Purchased for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.
Great for carrying in my purse Would recommend it to everyone small enough to fit in my purse
great for games This item was on sale for Black Friday. Perfect for traveling with kids.
Great for kids I love the camera. Easy for kids to use. Holds a lot of apps.
"Great for kids These kindled are great for my kids. There are parental controls, it allows them to have apps to play games that are approved for their profile. They are durable and don't have cracked screens with dropping."
Great for kids or adults Great for the price! Can't beat it. Good for a young kid or adult.
Great for kids when traveling I bought this for my grandson for a Christmas present.
Great for reading online books The tablet was easy to set up and use. Just the right size for travelling or relaxing at home. Great value for the price.
Great gift Great gift for my nieces. Its good for their games and movies
Great gift I bought this for my 11 year old to read on and she loves it!
Great inexpensive tablet. Great inexpensive tablet for kids to play with. The only downside with this tablet is the annoying ads. But I can't complain too much I only paid $35 for it.
Great product My son loves this tablet built tough and sturdy at great price
GREAT Reader!! These are PERFECT for the kids to use at home and in the car when traveling!!!
Great stocking stuffer I purchased this for my mother as a stocking stuffer.
Great tablet Purchased as a gift for a child and she loves it!!
great tablet for beginner my grandkids love it and they are five and they work it themselves
Great tablet for beginners I purchased this for my son and he loves it. It‚Äôs perfect for a child or someone who just wants a simple tablet.
"Great tablet!! I was shopping for a tablet for my mother. She uses her phone for games and social media, but she wanted a larger device, but wasnt interested in using features that may come with a much pricier tablet. This tablet is PERFECT for her. Battery lasts long, she can watch her shows, play games, and do social media while at her doctor appointments. It's light, durable, and a great price since she's on a fixed income. This tablet is so good, I'm still surprised at how good a price Best Buy had. Definitely recommend. I might even grab one myself!"
Great tablets Easy to use and very affodable. My kids love this tablet.
"Great, but ads? This tablet is perfect size. Bought for my niece. We both loved the color! Only thing to complain about is there is a lot of ads? Even when you unlock the lock screen. Not sure if there is a way to turn them off? But still, great product!"
"I enjoyed it I bought it in best buy for 30 dollars. Its very good except camera. Memory can be expanded. So far, im using it without any issues"
its not the best but works well overall its ok just make sure you have a memory card if you have a lot of apps
Kids love it Not expensive. Easy to use and kids totally love it!
"Like a paperwhite, only less expensive So this is the seventh or eighth kindle I own. It has a readable and backlit interface that light doesn‚Äôt disrupt. It isn‚Äôt the fastest web browser ever, but it does all things kindle very well. At Christmas prices you really can‚Äôt go wrong with this little tablet. Love!"
Love it I got this for my grandson and he just loves it! Durable and easy to manage.
Love my Amazon Fire 7 I am extremely happy with this purchase. I was always looking for the perfect iPad and I found that the Amazon fire 7 wasthe perfect choice.
Luv my Kindle Luv my Kindle and the free and discounted books. Wouldn't know what to do without it.
Nice Great for someone who never had anything like it before
"Nice I bought this tablet on sale when it was $30! For the price it's excellent! Does everything as expected and a nice bonus is the fact that the screen resolution is very nice and clear. Again, because I purchased it at such a low price it's hard to criticize specs such as the processor. I would have been a fine pick had it been the regular fifty bucks but, in case I didn't mention it already, it was $30"
Nice My son had the 4th generation tablet that came out in 2014 and it gave its last breath a couple days ago. Hes 4 and he likes to through things. But im amazed how long it lasted. This tablet i loved how much cheaper it was compared to the older versions. Other than the size and appearance of it it hasnt changed much. Which i like because it makes it easier for my son that he navigates it exactly like his older one. And i like that it has a memory card slot.
"Nice Tablet Had to be a couple of inexpensive tablets for work. It does everything it is supposed to, for a great price."
None yet Unable to fully review as this is a Christmas gift and has not been used yet.
Not living up to my expectation I found this devices battery very poor and also didn't like this device can't support screen share capabilities with my Amazon Fire TV or Smart TV's.
"Ok tablet I wish the tablet was faster and more consistent. It is ok as a first tablet, but not for someone who has owned many and wants to do many things with it."
Perfect gift This was purchased as a gift for my 14 year old who loves to read! She loves it.
Perfect tablet for anyone This is the perfect Amazon fire tablet for kids and young adults
"Practical tablet, easily replace kindle reader Practical table, slow, but enough to do essential things, replace a kindle reader to read by a cheapest price $29"
"Purchased for grandson Great learning tool for pre school and kindergarteners,also for playing their favorite games"
"Very easy to use Great for Watching sports Events. Facebook, very Fast. Very nice design."
"We love these We love our kindles so much. Each child has one (5), and they use them about daily."
"Well Worth The Money! These are great tablets, especially for the price! The imaging is great and it is easy to use. Hard to beat!"
1st time user Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.
"2nd purchase First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
"A big step up from Fire HD7 Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great."
A book readers best friend I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
"a decent cheap tablet and e-reader This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself."
"A good cheap tablet. I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
"A good product and easy for a kid to handle. This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
"A good step up from my old kindle tablet The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
A good tablet for this price.. I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.
"A great 7 inch tablet at a great price This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations."
A GREAT product for the price. I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.
A great tablet at a fabulous price I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
A great value for the product The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.
a simple machine this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
"All around great tablet I use this tablet to control music on my surround sound home speaker system. It works great for that purpose. Streams directly to the receiver with no lag, and fits perfectly on the wall. Great device for this purpose"
All around great!! Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
All I needed. Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.
"All in One Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements."
Alot of changes since my 1st Kindle fire I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
"Alright to do amazon or play games, watch videos I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep."
Always a great tablet. I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
Always in the go It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
Amazing deal The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it!
Amazing deal! We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!
Amazing!! I wanted something small to read books on on the go. This fit the bill perfectly! Not to big and not to small. It does more things than I was expecting!
Amazon Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games
Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet 16gb Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 32gb Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
Amazon Fire Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
Amazon Fire I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.
Amazon fire Our 3rd Amazon fire. The battery life is outstanding. Really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery. Nice size.
"Amazon Fire - Great 7"" Tablet Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size."
"Amazon Fire 16gb - I love this little tablet. This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy."
"amazon fire 7 Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
Amazon fire 7 This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
"Amazon fire 7 for kids This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
amazon fire 7 inch tablet amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.
"Amazon Fire 7 tablet 16gb Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
"Amazon Fire 7! This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device."
"Amazon Fire is a great starter tablet. The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos."

Amazon Fire Tablet Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
Amazon Fire Tablet This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.
"Amazon HD8 granddaughter tablet She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL"
Amazon is on Fire The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet I love my new Fire tablet. Nice backlight helps me to read my E-book in bed. Background color can be changed. I especially like the black background with white lettering; less glare on my eyes while reading.
"Amazon tablet This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
An excellant product. This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
An ok tablet It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
Another Table Replacement! Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.
Another winner. Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs.
"Appears good but should come with instruction book I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
Apps Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device
As good as other tablets Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.
"Awesome Awesome.. Everything I need and more. I'm very happy with the tablet.I'm very happy.Thank you,Kathleen Stroyek"

Awesome for new tablet user. I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!
Awesome product Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.
Awesome tablet Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.
"Awesome tablet for the price Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
Awesome tablet!! Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
"Awesome!!! If you are a Amazon Prime member, this is one of the best tablets to have, awesome!"
Awsome So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
bang for the buck for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
Bang for the buck limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works
Basic tablet/reader Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
Basically a big phone...without the phone This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.
"Beats carrying multiple books After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
"Best 7"" Kindle ever I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!"
Best dishwasher I've ever owned! I'm very tough on dishwashers and this one seems to be up to the challenge! I will never own another brand!
Best ever for my 4year old grandson My 4 Year old grandson likes to play games and watch movies. This was the best ever purchase I've done.
Best gift My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
Best gift for the wife ever. My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
"Best product for this price range Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
"Best tablet for our needs My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
"Best Tablet for tweens This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends."
"Best tablet on the market Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
Best tablet on the market for the money I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
Better every generation Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
"Better than before! The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!"
Better then I expected. I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.
Better then my first kindle i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read
"Big screen and clear resolution It's a nice upgrade from the 6"" screen. Size is just right for small kids hands. Reading kindle books is much easier."
"Big upgrade from the 7"" Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
Blockbuster Watch it over & over again!!! Blu ray is the best!
Book reader This is a great devise for reading books or taking photos. Best Buy Associate was very helpful.
bought for daughter in law and she likes it bought for daughter in law and she likes it. she wanted a fire
"Bought for my 24 year old daughter, she LOVES it!! It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her."
Bought for wife Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
Bought Kindle for my son He and his wife are delighted with it and the acess to the huge number of books available.
Broke in 5 mos I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
"Came defective bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective. the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible. comes in 4 different color. was 16gb enough space for kids, has camera, ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids"
"Came in for a charger, bought a new phone - G7 Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer."
Carry everywhere Love this kindle excellent price I just carry it everywhere. Fits perfectly in my purse.
Charging Port Does Not Last - Not good for kids! I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
"Cheap This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
"Cheap but functional device Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices."
"cheap, easy, slow Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides."
Christmas Gift I bought it for my fianc and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
Christmas Gift I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
Christmas Gift I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
"Christmas Gift for Mom This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
Confused The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
"Confusing for me; returning I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
"Cost to benefit ratio great My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
Crashed after update My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
Daughter loves it My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.
"Daughter loves this gift tablet! 23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her."
Decent Tablet This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
Decent Tablet for Teen Basic Games This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
Decent tablet for the money I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
DER Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.
Did not read reviews. My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
"didn't keep long but downgraded This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
Disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
"Disappointed Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
"Does a lot This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
Does exactly what I needed it for Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.
"Does it's job Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
Does the job My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
Does what I purchased it for. Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.
Does what I want A good product that provides the services I desire.
Dropbox Problem I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
Durable Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
Dwight Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
Ease of use Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
East to use I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
Easy access to my magazines and books. Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
"Easy enough for Grandpa Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
"Easy reader Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
"Easy Replacement This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"
Easy Setup Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
Easy start up All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.
Easy to access and set up. Love its simplicity. Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.
"Easy to hold and use. Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use."
Easy to hold. Fast loading. Beautiful design. I lo This tablet is light weight and thin which makes it ideal to hold on my hands. I love it!
"Easy to navigate, great product Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
Easy to navigate! I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to download all of her games and apps that she uses to have on the iPad.
"Easy to read with Fire The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process."
"Easy to use Bought it for my mom, it was real easy to transfer her downloads from her phone to the tablet.."
Easy to use Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.

"Easy to use and set up I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear."
Easy to use for beginner or advanced user! This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
"Easy to use, love it I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use."
Easy to use! This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.
Easy to use. Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.
Easy to used it .. I brought to my 2 nices and so far they are enjoy it ....

Entertainment for my mom I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
Entertainment! Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.
Exceeded my expectations I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
excellent Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.
"EXCELLENT Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
Excellent Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!
Excellent Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
Excellent Book Reader Easy access to book reader. Love watching my Netflix.Con - Slow getting on Internet.
Excellent budget tablet The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.
"Excellent buy Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."
Excellent buying experience This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
"Excellent choice for my mom My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
"Excellent choice! Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast."
"Excellent device This is an excellent device, however, I did take this back and exchanged it for an 8 which I simply love."
"Excellent for Amazon product users and shoppers. Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
Excellent for children Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.
Excellent for Monitoring the kids!! I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
Excellent for reading books. I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.
Excellent for the cost. I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
"Excellent for those entering the tablet world. This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
Excellent Functionality & Value The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
excellent item It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use
"Excellent low cost tablet This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version"
"Excellent Portable Media Device / Backup Tablet This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
Excellent Product I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
Excellent Product Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
Excellent product Tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet
"Excellent product for the money. It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
Excellent Product For The Price Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
Excellent Product For The Price Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
Excellent product for the price I needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips. Bought two of these and boy do they deliver!!! The best tablets for this price. The kindle book reader is an added bonus. The finishing is good. My kids love it.
"Excellent small tablet and outstanding e-reader! This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!"
excellent tablet bought it for my son. he likes it. very good alternate to expensive tables out there.
Excellent tablet I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.
Excellent tablet I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.
Excellent Tablet This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!
"Excellent Tablet This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
excellent tablet Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
Excellent tablet Christmas gift for my niece Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase
Excellent tablet for the money You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
Excellent tablet forever I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good
"Excellent tablet/reader for travel I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet."
Fantastic Tablet Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
Fantastic tablet for reading This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.
Fantastic tablet for simplicity Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!
Fantastic tablet! I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
Fantastic tablet! I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
Fine It's a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it's not what I was thought it's going to be I returned it back just be of this reason
"Fine for Books Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
Fine for what we need Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
Fire 7 Tablet It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
"Fire HD 8 I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
"Fire HD tablets It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
"fire is easy to use. convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
Fire tablet Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
Fire tablet Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
Fire Tablet I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.
Fire Tablet I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
Fire tablet It's great for kids for a cheap iPad alternative however need credit card and no way to prevent accidental purchases
"Fire Tablet - great for entertainment I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
Fire! Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!
"First Tablet I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things."
"First time tablet owner Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"
Fits I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
Fits perfectly in my hand I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
For grandkids Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
For my grandson. He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
For my sister birthday This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.
For my son.... I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
Frees up parents phones Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
Fun new toy This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
Fun Product! Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
Fun tablet Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
Functional at a good deal. I'm normally an Apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the Amazon Fire is.
Gave as a gift the recipient of this tablet uses it often and loves it so much that I'm buying one for myself.
"Gearfit2 Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome"
Geat tablet for everyone So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .
"Gets the job done very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
Gets the job done Was looking for something small I could use to get on the Internet and check emails and this is prefect for that
Gift Bought as a gift but have not had any issues with products purchased from you
"gift I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader."
Gift Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
Gift for mom Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.
Gift For Son Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.
Gift Purchase Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew for his birthday. He had been asking for a tablet forever. I made his day! He loves his tablet. All he's does is watch you tube and play games
give for my granddaughter and she seems happy It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
Glad I purchased this item I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it
goes off I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
good Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
good everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do...
Good Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
Good I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet
"good it was good, works pretty easily. the camera is good."
Good - But could be much better. Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
"Good and cheap Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy"
"good and low cost great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
Good as long as it is plugged in to outlet. Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
Good basic tablet Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
"good basic tablet Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life"
Good beginner tablet Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.
Good beginner tablet. I'm very ignorant of tablets. I bought this for my 2 year old and it has a lot to offer.
Good buy This item works great and fitst anywhere. I have no complaints...
Good cheap tablet Great tablet especially for the price it's not an iPad by any means but will run and play a lot of androids apps works off wifi and has a micro ad card reader
"Good Cheap Tablet Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
"Good deal good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for"
Good deal Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
Good Deal Liked the first one so much I bought one for the wife
GOOD DEAL Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
good deal and on sale too! Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
Good device Nice device I like to use it to read books online.
Good entertainment Kids love it! Great Christmas present even if not an apple product.
Good experience & customer service Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
"Good First Tablet I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK."
"Good first tablet for kids Bought this for my 3rd grader when her school suggested to parents to get a tablet, they use them occasionally in school. This inexpensive one fits the bill just fine."
"Good For a Cheap Tablet Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
"Good for children I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
"good for emails and social media I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes."
"Good for first time kindle owner I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
Good for its money. Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
Good for kids Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.
Good for kids It's a good device for children because they don't know any better
"Good for kids It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet"
Good for kids We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
Good for kids to use Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
Good for me The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
"Good for movies and amazon Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
Good for my 11 year old son My son uses the device to help him do his homework
"Good for reading and internet. I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy."
"Good for reading and simple homework. Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
"Good for reading book. Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small."
"Good for reading books. Ok for a lot of activity The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
Good for the beginner Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
"Good for the money For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
Good for the money While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
Good for the price Excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at Bestbuy
Good for the price I bought this to read books on. Excellent for that. Difficult to navigate otherwise
"Good for the price Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
Good for the price Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
"Good for the price Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."
"Good for what I use it for I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
Good fun The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.
Good inexpensive tablet Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.
Good Intro Tablet Great little tablet once you get the hang of it. I bought this for my wife and she uses it daily without any issues.
Good laptop for the price It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
Good little tablet Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
"Good little tablet Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics"
Good one to play with The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
Good picture and sound quality Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.
good present for brother my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
Good price My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.

"good product works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
"good product for kids Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
Good product for price Enjoy using this product. My granddaughter downloads multiplied games to play and can play them while traveling. Good size and can easily fit into small bag.
Good product my son loves it... My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.
"good quality good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
good quality for school Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
"Good Reader I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
"Good Reader Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage."

Good tablet for amazon users This tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users. Not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users
"Good tablet for average use The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
Good tablet for basic purposes I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It's good if you don't have an ample scope of tasks
Good tablet for everyday use Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.

"Good tablet. I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
"Good tablet. Not great, but good. I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
good tabllet for the money I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
"Good value For the price you can't beat this little tablet, it does an awesome job!"

"Good value Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
"Good, but can be better It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
"Got Grandsons? We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
Got this for my 3 year old Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!

Great 4 kids Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
"great affordable tablet I'm very pleased with my Kindle fire. I've used it more than I thought I would, as I primarily was getting it for reading, but wanted the internet access and ability to review and edit documents, too. In addition to reading more lately than I usually do, I'm also turning my Fire on instead of my desk top computer if I'm only going to use it a short time."
Great Alternative to Ipad I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
"great Amazon device If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"

"Great beginner tablet. I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price."
"Great Big Thank YOU, I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is ""Mom, you are the best"", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!"
great birthday gift I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
Great Bluetooth device for audible books I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.
"Great buddie I'm enjoying my amazon fire. I've been reading great books, checking my e-mail and shopping.I highly recommend this product..value great quality great.You won't be disappointed."

Great Cheap Tablet This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.
Great Choice All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
Great Christmas Gift We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
"Great Christmas gift! My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
great color Love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what I needed it for great price
great color screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
Great color Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
Great computer for gamer It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
"Great deal on a great basic tablet This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them."
"great device Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
Great Device I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.

"Great device for reading and playing games. Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
Great Device! Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.
Great E reader This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.
"Great e-reader If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
Great e-reader tablet Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.
Great e-reader! Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!
"Great entry level tablet Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound."
"Great Entry Level Tablet This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
Great Find Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus. Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas
Great First Tablet I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.

Great little reader This is my first fire and I love it! It is perfect for taking my books on the go without having the large bulky books!

Great little tablet if you dont need HD resolution Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
"Great mini tablet For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse!"
Great Multi Use Kindle I like the way I can read many books and magazines as well as play various games on my kindle.

Great Price I purchased this for raffle prizes and they're great for the price.
Great price Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
"Great price and size Product was a Christmas gift, to replace and older Kindle Fire"
Great Price for Nice Tablet This is the second one I have Purchased. I purchased the 16 MB version for less than 50.00. As long as you understand it is an Amazon product it a darn good Tablet for the money
"Great price on an awesome little tablet I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."
Great price point You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.

"Great product does the job! I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies""."

Great replacement for old black and white kindle So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.

It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."

"Great Tablet I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader."

Great tablet for price Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
"Great Tablet for Readers This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me."

"Great tablet for the money! You won't regret it! This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."

"Great Tablet with lots of functionality. I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."

Great Tablets I Bought Two Of The Amazon Fire Tablets For My 6 & 8 Year Old And I've Had No Problems With Them. They Don't Have Some Of The Games That You Can Download On An Android Market But Other Then That The Tablets Overall Are Great Especially For Kids Sense They Have a Child's Browsing & Adult Browsing With Parental Locks.
Great tablets for reading books Love this tablet have had several others but this brand works everytime..very happy with my purchase
"Great to Read a variety of books It has a clear screen, the books are easy to download, I like the other features as well."
"Great to use and handy Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great"
Great to watch movies I like to watch movies on it. But it doesn't see to connect correctly to WiFi.
great tv for a guest room just what I was looking for to putin my guest room. It has a good picture
Great TV for the price. Good size for space I had for the TV. The color is good.

Great value and product Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant.
"Great value for the money. I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."

"Great. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."
Gud buget tablet I like the price and features of the tablet . Its great in this price
Handheld light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images
Handy size tablet This tablet operates wonderfully. The size is handy. The graphics vibrant.For the affordable price it is unbeatable :-)
"Happier than I expected I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
Happy with purchase I bought this for my niece. She uses this for E-books. Better than having to store tons of books in her case.
"Happy with this product Good reader, nice small tablet, charging cord is to short."
"Happy with this purchase I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product."
"Has everything you need This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
Hassle Free Nice size and color. It was easy to grip. very pleased
"HD makes big difference I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
Heard good things about it Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it
Hells Yeah!!! So I was given a HD for Christmas and when this went on sale in time for Father's Day I had to get it... Love that it has the expansion slot!!!
High-quality inexpensive tablet I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.
Highly recommend The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
"I bought it for travel, but barely used it. It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
I brought it for my sister birthday She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much
"I cherish my kindle it's my window to the world. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
"I do not like this tablet. Period. I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
I enjoy all of the features I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.
I like the bigger screen. My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
"I like the size and the fact that it is compact. I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
"I love my Amazon Fire tablet I so love my Amazon fire tabletYou have.everything you want books, games etc. The picture are so clear and beautiful. I can't keep my son off of it . I'm thinking about getting another for him .He love watching videos of his favorite show"
I love my Kindle I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here
I love my kindle ! The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
I love the watch The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.
I love this Kindle This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.
I loved it! I love the camera quality and secured apps available for download. But if you're looking for specific apps research to see if it's available first. Had to return to get an android tablet for gaming purposes
I really enjoy this Kindle It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.
I was expecting more It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
"I wish I started with this one! Thrilled with the ease of use, so easy to navigate! I wish I had started with a tablet like this, it would have saved me a lot of frustration."
"I'm loving it I wish I could just say it is one of my best investment, I love the fact that now I don't have to drag around several of my favorite books I can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it I think it's great I should have gotten more memory though"
Im so happy with this product - Reading is GREAT! I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!
"IN MY VIEW, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST READING TABLET GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
Inexpensive tablet Slower that my iPad. Love it. Cheaper and better than my Kindle Paperwhite with much more storage. Also bought 128 micro SD card. Prime member and use it to download free with prime movies
Internet connection shotty I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
intuitive Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
Is a great gift for the kids. This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
Is what it is Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
"It fits my need perfectly My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
It is a good starter tablet. Bought it for my 8 yr old for Christmas and he loved it. I like that some of the apps that come with it can be deleted making more room for apps you would want to add.
It is perfect for a first tablet! I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
It was the I deal gift for my gran child It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
It works i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
It works great & fast. This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
"It's a great deal! It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it."
It's a Kindle! Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
"It's an ok tablet for the price. In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
it's awesome i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.
It's her second one! My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!
It's okay I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
"It's perfect!! Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words."
It's simple to use and my daughter loves it. I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
It's the 4th one I buy. This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
Its a gift Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
"Its gd if you like amazon Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on."
Just what a 7 year old needs I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
Just what I was looking for Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation
"Keeps getting better I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account."
Keeps the grand kids busy Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games
Kid friendly Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven't had any problems
KID FRIENDLY TABLET We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.
Kids friendly My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
Kids love it Great price! Kids love it. Lots of space for apps!
Kindle I got this to replace my Samsung tablet. I read alot and so i figured that the kindle would be ok to use. I have found that it works great with the books that I read and I really like the Blue Light feature making it easier to fall asleep reading.
kindle It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it
Kindle Love this tablet! This is my second. Just couldn't beat the price!!
"Kindle The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!"
Kindle 2nd I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
Kindle Fire Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
"Kindle FIRE Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
Kindle fire This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
Kindle Fire This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable
"kindle fire 16 gig magenta I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome ."
Kindle Fire 7 Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
Kindle Fire great for reading Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
"kindle fire is great Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!"
"Kindle Fire is on Fire Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen."
"Kindle Fire, SWEET I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet!"
Kindle for grandchild I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
Kindle HD No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
Kindle hd7 Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor.
"Kindle is overrated Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it."
Kindle just for books We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
Kindle love I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
Kindle produces great products Any Kindle product I have purchased is easy to use
Kindle tablet This product does what it say it do. I really enjoy reading
Kindles rock I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.
Lags Performance Eventually It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
"lAmazon Fire tablet - One of my Best Buy's Love this product, and don't know why it took so l"
"less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast! Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
light and compact i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
Lighter weight Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me.
"Lightweight, easy to use tablet I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
Like our Kindle Fire Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc√© downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
like the kindle was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
Lots of Nice Features So far my Fire is working well. I did have difficulty setting it up initially and had to ask a Best Buy tech to help me out. Connecting with my wireless was the most difficult step. The print is easy to read and can be enlarged. It is nice to be able to access e-mail. I find that it is easier to use if placed in a book-style protective case. That makes it easier to hold while reading. Anyone should enjoy using the Fire!
"Love a kindle A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."

Love It We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use
"Love it - and yes you can use with Nook books too! Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy."
Love it and can't live without it. User friendly. Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.
"love it works great battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint."
love it! fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
Love it! I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.
"Love it! This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps."
Love it!!! I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
"Love it!!! I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone ."
Love it!!! This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to.
"Love it. Battery life is awesome I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them."
Love Kindle Fire I love this product. Perfect size for travel. I take it everywhere. Great for watching videos as well.
"Love my Fire Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
"Love my Fire I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my ""library"" that's not taking up space on my phone."
Love my Fire My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows
"Love my Fire! I debated on what tablet/reader to buy and decided on the fire! I have been very pleased with it. Bought it on sale, what a great price!"
love my kindle bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!
Love my Kindle Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
Love my Kindle I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
"Love my Kindle It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
Love my kindle Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas
Love my kindle Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.
Love my kindle Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
"Love My Kindle This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle."
Love my kindle This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
Love my Kindle Fire I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.
Love my kindles Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
Love my kindles!!! This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
Love my new Fire Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
Love the Amazon Fire Tablet The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.
Love the convenience in the palm of your hand Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
"Love the ease of use Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect."
Love the Fire Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.
Love the Fire! My Fire Kindle is wonderful and I use it all the time.
Love the kindle! I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased.
Love the Kindle. Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.
"Love the new options available on my new Kindle I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!!"
"Love the new tablet! I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it."
"Love the response time I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store."
Love the Tablet I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
Love the versatility of this Fire This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements.
"Love this Fire! Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read."
Love this Kindle Fire Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.
Love this tablet Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.
Love this thing My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
love to read and get free books I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.
loved it was a great purchase. loved the color and the camera feature
Loving It I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
Loving the pink look. I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.
low priced tablet My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.
Luv this Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
Made a great gift Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
Made a great gift This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
Magic picture box This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
Mediocre This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
"More than an ebook reader. This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!"
Much slimmer profile best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
"Multi-Function Tablet Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"
My 8 year old daughter loves it My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
My daughter in law loved it! Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
"My daughter loves her new Fire tablet. My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at."
"My daughter loves it! I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them."
My daughter loves this This is her second Kindle product. she loves the new colors and bigger screen.
"My first tablet This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point."
My granddaughter is happy with her Fire HD8 I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
my grandson loves it I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
"My grandson loves it, This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards."
"My K FIre I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
"my Kids love them Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
My order My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
My readER and gamer Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
My Sister's gift I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
My son enjoys his tablet! This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.
My son loves it! Perfect device for gaming apps and on-the-go streaming!
My Son loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great tablet. Perfect for my 8 year old son!!!!!!!!!!!
My w My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
My wife loves it We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air
"My wife loves it! This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
"My wife's birthday present She loves it, she has one of the first Kindles and uses it daily, so this new one was a surprise and she enjoys the color in some of the cookbooks. The clarity and the Washington Post was an added feature, and fact that it was so easy to use."
Neat tablet This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.
Needed to replace my broken KindleFire This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
"Nephew's Birthday Gift Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!"
New kindle I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
Newer & better Kindle Fire I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
nice got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
Nice No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
Nice 7in tablet Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.
"Nice affordable tablet This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable"
"Nice Amazon tablet This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
Nice basic item Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
"Nice compact tablet I bought this for my wife, basically just for reading books. She has come to love it. She is constantly reading. Lighting wasn't an issue or I would have gotten the reader.When she isn't reading, I borrow it for puzzle type games, and it is great. Not a iPad by any stretch but it is more convenient than the mini that she also owns. Prior to the Amazon Fire she was reading on the iPhone 6+.a"
"Nice easy to use A friend loves hers & told me I would love it, I do"
Nice entry-level tablet Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
"Nice for a beginner This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere."
Nice for Streaming Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
Nice for the price If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.
Nice gadget My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
Nice gift idea This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
Nice improvement over previous models Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
Nice item. We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
Nice Kindle Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
Nice little tablet This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
Nice phone system I love my new Panasonic phone system. It has 2 handsets which is a good idea for those living with family! I also like the ease of operating the answering machine as well. Thank you Best Buy!
"Nice product for the price We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
"Nice simple tablet Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced"
Nice size to travel with. Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
Nice tablet Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
Nice tablet I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!
Nice tablet My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!
Nice tablet Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.
Nice tablet Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
Nice Tablet for the money Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
Nice tablet simple and too many things to do. Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy.
nice to have nice to have to watch netflexs on in bed and relax.
Nice upgrade My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.
niece loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect
No good I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
Noce I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
"Not a huge fan Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
not as good as an ipad but gets the job done i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done
"Not as good as before Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better"
Not good Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again
Not Horrible Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
"Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
Not like other android tablets This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
Not looking too good... I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
"Not off to a great start. When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet."
Not perfect but excellent Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
Not really statisfied with features Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it
Not so good! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
"Not the greatest for kids We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
"Not user Friendly Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
Not what I need. I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
Not what I was expecting. I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
"Now do not have to carry around a laptop. This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"OK For Entry Level Tablet My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."
"Ok for reading, not so much for browsing good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing."
Ok for the price. Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
Ok for what you pay Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
"Ok product Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok"
ok tablet for a small child The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.
"Ok Tablet for the Price Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
"Okay Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available"
Okay for a small tablet Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
Okay tablet Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage.  Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.

Outstanding Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
"Overall great But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
"Overall okay Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store."
Perfect Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
Perfect I love this tablet. It's the perfect size for my kid. Keeps him entertained during long trips. We picked up the free time kid proof case and it's perfect also.
Perfect It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
Perfect My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
"Perfect Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!"
Perfect Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
"Perfect combination of a tablet and reader I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
"Perfect for Beginners... Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
"Perfect for kids This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
"Perfect for kids and prime members Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
"Perfect for Mom I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs."
"Perfect for my daughter Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."
Perfect for my first tablet Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...
Perfect for my kids It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
Perfect for my kids My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
Perfect for my son! So happy with the color choices! This will be perfect for my 10 year old and I am thrilled with thr price!
"Perfect for my uses and can't beat the price I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it."
"Perfect for non-tech-savvy parents. Purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. Perfect size. The front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added FB, sharing photos was easy. Amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of Kindle books. There are Amazon ads on the Kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device."
Perfect for the Price! A great tablet for the price--really no major complaints!
Perfect for the reader Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.
Perfect for travel Does everything I need and has a long battery life.
"Perfect Grad Gift This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
"Perfect Kids Tablet Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy."
"PERFECT SIZE PERFECT SIZE FOR TRAVELING, COMPACT AND LIGHT, AMAZON APPS ARE INCLUDED, GREAT FOR STREAMING VIDEOS AND SHOWS ON THE GO!!!!"
perfect size we had an older model from 2012 and it broke so we just replaced with newer one. Love the new features.
Perfect size for my son I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.
"perfect stream device Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase."
"Piece of junk Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
poor photo quality Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
Poor quality tablet I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
Pretty good but slow internet I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
Pretty good for the price So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !
Product/Price value is awesome. The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price.
"purchased for outdoor living space Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
Purchased to read books and web browsing Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
"Quite happy! So far, so good. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn't anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable."
Reader Good product and the quality of the product is good. Easy to use.
Really good for reading and downloading apps I personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun
"Really good tablet I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
Really like for reading books at Lunch My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
really nice works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
reliable This is my son's 4th kindle. It is reliable but the charging plug area wears out quickly
"Returned Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
Returned I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
"Satisfied, good buy Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially."
satisified nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
Second one purchased For 7 year old. Now has two in different colors - can tell what is on which one by color.
"Serves my tablet needs perfectly For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
Serves the purpose I only bought this as a travel companion when I fly. It was cheap and functional.
short battery life The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!
"Should have bought one long ago! I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!"
"Significantly improved This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker."
Simple tablet Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
Simple to use I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
"Simply Awesome. Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device."
"Slow! Don't waste you money! I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
Small tablet This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
So far so good I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
So far so good.. So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
"So far, so good Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!"
"so fast I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
So improved My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
"Solid product We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need."
Solid tablet I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues
Solid tablet! This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
"Soooo cool! I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!"
Stay away Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
Still learning product. Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.
Students will love this! I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
Suits me fine Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
Super fast tablet love it! Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
Super present Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
Tab Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
Tablet Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
Tablet Had a kids fire and switched to this with a kids case and tempered glass this time works really well for kids
Tablet I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
Tablet It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
"Tablet Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven't put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!!"
"Tablet This is a first for an adult. Price is right, easy to use and just the right size."
Tablet does everything it's supposed to do I gave it away. It was too nice for me. The person I gave it to was gleeful.
tablet for my grandchild my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
Tablet for my son I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
Tablet for the kiddo Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
"Tablet will not charge The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
"Tablet worked as it should, but... I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
"Tablet works pretty good, just getting started. I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
"techy kids will like great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
Terrible I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
Terrible Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
"The Amazon Fire is a great reading instrument. I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
"The best tablet for anything Amazon Great to view movies, play games, surf the net. Makes shopping on Amazon music easy"
The Fire is good for the price I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
The perfect reader The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
The size is great for taking on the road The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
The tablet I bought was a 3th birthday gift.. Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....
The wife loves her new fire tablet Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.
"They love it Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one."
Third Kindle This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
This is a great tablet for the price This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.
"This is my 5th Kindle So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books."
This item is not my primary tablet but is adequate This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.
This unit worked great This Fire worked great but I returned it because it was not the one I wantedBest Buy took it back for a full refund with no problems Best Buy is alsome
this was an upgrade Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
Thought id try I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
"Thought it was perfect for my 7!yr old It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate"
Too small Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
Top rated - Amazon Fire 7 tablet You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!
"Unbelievable Value The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
"Unexpected Tablet I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
"Unfortunate Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy."
"Use my kindle 8 more than my laptop! I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
"Used daily I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music."
user friendly Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.
User Friendly I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.
Uss it all the time Upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was 4 years old. So worth it.
Value for money My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
"Value for money With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
Very durable! This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.
Very easy to use I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
Very efficient I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
"Very Good The best product name on the market,no doubt about it."
Very good for the money I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
Very good Kindle for the price. Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
Very good price for the quality of the product Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
Very good product Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
Very good product - easy to use Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
"Very Good Tablet Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
Very good tablet I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
"Very good tablet for basic use Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games."
Very good. It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.
very googd product is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks
very handy device Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
Very happy Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
"Very Happy Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
Very happy with it. I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
very happy with new Kindle Fire This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
Very nice This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
"Very nice simple tablet Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent."
Very nice tablett I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
Very pleased. Gift was on point. Recipient was very pleased. Would recommend to others.
"Very satisfied with the price and ease of use. There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app."
"Very sturdy for a 5 year old I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
"Very versatile I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
visuals I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
"Was for my wife who loves it This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
We love the books that you can read. My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.
We love the books that you can read. My daughter loves it. She loves the books that she can read.
Well satisfied with the TV Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product
"Who needs a laptop? I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod"
"Wife absolutley loves her new Fire HD 8 tablet Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
Wife likes it This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device
Wife likes it. Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.
Wife likes it. Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
Wife loved it I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
"Wife Loves it Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
Wish it had more I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
"Wonderful I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!"
"wonderful I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it"
Wonderful colors I love the touch screen aspect still love the original.
"Wonderful tablet at a price that can't be beat (accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one."
Works as advertised Brother in law loves it. He's not very technical so perfect for him.
Works as described My second one and works better than the first one.
"Works as Intended. Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself."
Works great Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
"Works great It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
Works great Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
"Works great Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great."
"Works great for what I need for nursing class This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet."
"Works Well Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!"
Works well and fully functional Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.
"Works well, but Needs Better Parental Options The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
Works well. Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.
world The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
"Worst Fire Tablet of all I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on."
"Worst product I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
worth the $ Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
Worth the money. Very fun for the kids My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
Yes Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
"A great tablet for beginners and Amazon fans This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
"Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 8"" - Tablet - 16GB Excellent upgrade for my wife's original 7"" 8GB Fire Tablet. Great graphics and very powerful!"
Amazon tablet Got this gift as a present for Christmas for my son. He enjoys playing games on it and watching Netflix
Awesome This is well worth the money spent and I recommend it. The new upgrades are nice.
Awesome computer The great Best Buy associate helped fit us with the perfect computer for what we need. We love it.
"Awesome low cost tablet I bought the Fire HD 8 with 16MB ram on sale for $49.99 ($30 off sale and tax free day). My intent is to use it primarily to surf the internet while on the couch in front of the TV or in bed. If you've been using your cell phone to surf the internet at home this is a great solution for a more comfortable experience.Like others have stated, the Amazon Fire O/S is an Android flavor that Amazon modified and as such you can easily install the Google Playstore which allows you to download most of your favorite apps. You don't have to ""hack"" it to do this and installing the Google Playstore allows you to install the Chrome browser among other things. Basically, the Google apps and the Amazon Fire apps can coexist together so you don't have to remove any of the Amazon content or apps. Install Chrome, Gmail, Youtube, a nicer keyboard app and many Google apps as you like.Also, for those concerned that about the Amazon advertisements that show up ONLY ON THE LOCK SCREEN don't sweat it. No, you don't have to pay Amazon the extra $15 for an ad free lock screen. Simply call Amazon or open up a chat window with an Amazon rep and ask them to kindly remove the advertisements. It takes two minutes for them to do it remotely and apparently Amazon wants you to be a happy customer so they'll gladly do this for free.For $49.99 I'm very happy with the Amazon Fire HD 8. Lastly, I recommend the ZtoTop version of the case, the version with the built in handle that allows you to slide your hand in the backstrap to easily hold it without effort."
Awesome Tablet for a teenager I bought my grandson this tablet because it was easy to use and it was at a awesome price.
AWESOME tablet! I love this tablet. Very responsive and fast for a cheap tablet. just the right size! I bought 2 of them! the battery last a long time also! HIGHLY recommend it! It has Alexa built into it also!
"Bargain Sharp screen, surprisingly quick web surfing with the Silk browser. Easy to add Google Store (albeit without Amazon's support) so you may add Google apps such as PlayBooks, etc. So you're not really locked into Amazon's ecosystem. The lockscreen ads are only seen for a few moments after you press the standby button and then swipe; so you won't even be tempted to pay Amazon the extra $ to have them remove it (remotely). Very happy."
"Best $50.00 tablet What can be said. For the sale price of $50.00 this was a great purchase. Not a high end tablet but for ebooks, movies, email and web browsing I have no complaints."
Best for the price Gift to my sister and she is loving it. It was a sweet deal!!
"Best Tablet for Under 100 You may be locked into Fire OS, but for 90 of what you do on a tablet it is not a problem."
"Better Storage but not better speakers I love my new Kindle the screen is great and I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more storage. However, the speaker sounds like mono instead of stereo. The sound is loud and clear but it would have been great if they had a speaker on each side of the Kindle."
"Bought it for the color, love it for the value I bought this for my MIL, who loves Kindle and podcasts, but finds it harder to get to her desktop to get online. This tablet has me thinking seriously why I paid nearly 1,000 for an ipad (my 4th). The screen is gorgeous and the setup is easy. Ok, I'll confess, I bought it because of the yellow body--our favorite color and easy to find in a pile of books!"
"Can't beat the features for the money While there are many budget tablets out there, not all of them are functional. This one is. If you are part of the Amazon universe this links seamlessly. Book purchases sync without effort. Movies are easy to see on Amazon Prime and you can use Netflix also. Alexa is an added bonus. Not sure the camera will get much use but it is there if you want it. Amazon is slowly opening up their market place to other popular apps so expect more. (Note: I turned off the WiFi and just used this as an e-reader and didn't have to charge it for almost 2 weeks!)"
Can't beat the price For the money you can't beat what you get. iPads still rule and are far better when you aren't connected to wifi but given the cost difference I think this is the best andriod to compete with it.
"Can't beat the price. This tablet is great if you have Amazon Prime. You really cant beat it for the price. I also have the 7"" version."
Come with ads on homesceeen This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising
Decent tablet for a decent price While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags. I've watched movies on this from my Amazon prime account and have read my books from my Kindle account and everything works well. It's not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner!
"Decent tablet for reading If it weren't for the limitations of the tablet to just Amazon things, this would've been a great tablet overall.The battery is good, Display is decent for reading."
Easy to download and begin My grandchildren have mastered the Kindles. They are ages 5-10 and can do anything with them. I have some avid readers and the four have discovered how to play games against each other with each having a kindle. I love this kindle. It was easy to download everything and link to internet.
Easy to use Gift for Nana. She said it was so easy to set up. Picture is great. Also it is much faster than her older model!
Easy to use! Much better than my older Kindel. This is my third Kindel. They just keep getting better.
"Excellent product Great product I use at night to watch shows on, play games and listen to music."
Excellent Product I purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law and she loves it!! It is very easy for her to use and read the screen.
Excellent Tab I bought this tab for my 5 years old kid.The tab is excellent and my son liked it very much.
"Excellent tablet. Very sleek. I love the Amazon fire. It is very user friendly. It's great for reading books, streaming music, and watching movies."
"Excellent value Amazon tablet Cannot beat the price for this Fire HD 8inch tablet--just the right size and during Black Friday, it was less than $50. Graphics are superb, tablet very easy to use."
Exceptional Great value for the price..
Family friendly We purchased item as a Christmas gift. Was a hit for sure
"Fantastic for the price! Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough? Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my $900 smartphone, $1000 laptop and $500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem. When it is it's very annoying.Screen is meh. It's good enough to not be a bother but coming from a 4k laptop and AMOLED display on my Google pixel XL, the screen is lacking. To the standard user, I don't think it will be noticeable though, and looks pretty good.Case and screen protector selection are sad and limited. Hopefully that changes soon as this tablet was just released this month.Cameras are useless. Not what I bought the tablet for so it didn't bother me one bit, but don't buy it for the cameras, a potato could take better photos.CONCLUSION:So overall I adore this tablet. I use it every day and now that I can have my Google apps and such on it, it is a fully functional Android tablet. It's wonderful, suits my needs, and hasn't disappointed me yet. Highly recommend."
"Fire HD 8 Unbelievable price. Purchased two, one for myself and gift for grandchild. Shipped and arrived with 3 days!"
Fire HD 8 tablet It is a great tablet. Especially one to carry around in a backpack because it is also tough. It was a great price on it also.
Fire hd awesome I love my fire hd I have read four books and play all my games on it.......it is an awesome deal for seventy-nine dollars .......it is a great tablet........like I said I love it ......
"FIRE IS A GREAT BUY! Excellent for the price point. Light weight, good display, connectivity is good, runs pretty smooth, and it's better than getting an iPad and spending hundreds of dollars. This is worth the price and this will be my tablet of preference from now on."
Fire Tablet HD Bought this product for a friend and she loves it. I plan to buy myself one now.
Fun for beginner Its very cool great picture good sound. Was kind of disappointed that i couldnt make calls but overall great piece of hardwark
Geeat tablet Its good tablet. Cheap and nice items and nice service
Good It was ready when Target said it would be and the product is outstanding.
Good buy Purchased for my god daughter as a gift easy to use would recommend this product for young and old

Great color got the yellow Came in one piece looks great but haven't used it.
Great deal Wanted to upgrade my grandaughter's kindle. I know she will enjoy it as much as her previous one.
"Great device! Works great especially if you have Amazon prime and other Amazon devices. Connect all of your Amazon devices to your wifi and suddenly your home just got smarter. The tablet is quick and snappy, and the battery life is astounding! I went about a week straight of 2-3 hours of use before it finally needed charging. Overall I am happy with this purchase!"
"Great family tablet I bought this for my toddler. I love the parental control feature, that way my toddler isn‚Äôt mistakenly purchasing videos or watching what I don‚Äôt want them too."
Great find The tablet works great for basic apps like facebook and candy crush. my father likes how easy it is to use.
"Great first tablet Great first tablet for 6 year old, purchased with a slicone case for protection. Best Buy had great holiday pricing."

"Great for the cost It doesn't compete with the iPad in terms of screen resolution or performance but for the price it does remarkably well. Battery life is outstanding compared to the 7"" fire. Very pleased with the purchase."
Great gift My daughter loves her new tablet. Her and my other daughter we're sharing and Samsung tablet but because in such a fan of Amazon I decided to do research and I ended up getting here this one and she loves it. She even said it has more features than her previous one.
Great picture & sound Good portable video /tv access.Able to view my subscription TV live shows when traveling.
Great price for tablet Overall good performance. It works fast and comes with many apps
Great product Better cost value than IPads. Tablet is user friendly and convenient. Anyone can use this
Great product Great product that does everything I need it to be
Great Product This generation of kindle fire is excellent. The addition of alexa was key.
Great Product This is a great tablet. Does everthing and more that a tablet should do.
"Great Produxt Great product. It was easy to set it up and had it running in no time flat. Was a gift for me mom Who is tech challenged, she was using it very quickly."
Great reader/tablet for the price The Kindle Fire HD was a replacement for a previous generation fire and the improvements are noticeable. Thinner profile and much nicer screen image are immediately noticeable. Video loooks great and the features on the Fire are outstanding for such a low price point. Highly recommended for a basic tablet as compared to far more expensive options.
"Great Tablet Bought for my daughter. Has everything she needs, great value"
Great Tablet Bought this as a gift for my 66 yr old dad. He loves it. Uses it everyday. Easy to learn and navigate. Would highly recommend for an alternative to the expensive ipads.
Great tablet Bought this for my son and he loves it.I will recommenf this tablet
Great tablet Easy to to set up & operate very lite weight nice color
Great tablet Great tablet for simple uses... not an iPad but it performs the base needs
"great tablet I love it, excellent tablet, fast, portable, good."
"Great Tablet I love this tablet, amazon did a great job with this one, Alexa is an added plus"
"Great tablet I was pleasantly surprised by the power and versatility of this tablet, so glad I got the 8"" screen version."
Great tablet This is a nice size for holding and viewing. I debated on getting the next size up but glad I didn't. You can also create different profiles. I set up a separate profile for my granddaughter and it allowed me to add restrictions so she can't access certain things or make purchases in apps. It also gave me a 30 day free trial for Amazon FreeTime which has so much content just for children. Happy with the price and product.
Great tablet This tablet is small and practical. Very convenient and fast.
Great tablet We bought this for our three year old son. He loves it. Plus it has many options for us to keep him from seeing things he shouldn't. The layout is really simple also making it great for children or adults!
Great Tablet even for younger kids! This tablet is easy to use and has every app avail
Great tablet for a beginner Tablet is easy to use. Wish there were more paper instructions
Great tablet for the money If you are an Amazon customer and just want a simple tablet this fits the bill and works great. Not an iPad but not $300++ either!
Great tablet for the price I grabbed this for a friend for christmas. He seems very happy with it
"great tablet for the price works great, easy to read, portable, great value for the money"
Great! I had a kindle before purchasing this product. I love the new features and color screen. It is easy to read at night and the filter to remove the blue light eliminates the eye strain. I had it read short stories to me at bed time last night. That is a great feature.
Greatest Love these tablets so much. This is the third one I purchased for someone else in the family
"HOOKED on my Fire 8HD I've owned a couple iPads, three Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and I can without question say that this Fire 8HD is my favorite out of all. The 16Gig version is all you need. Why? Becuase the micro-sd card expands to 256 gig and the programs can be installed to the external drive...saving the valuable internal for the operating system. Samsung should do the same...if they did, I'd probably wouldn't have bought the Fire, but I'm so glad I did!! Love, love, love it!!"
"Huge upgrade from the 7"" The extra ram makes all the difference regarding speed and responsiveness"
"Improved from last year Compared to last years 7' this is a worthy upgrade. More storage and screen size by default. The OS is much more improved on the new hardware and is actually snappy and responsive. My only gripe is the old type connection that kids love to either try force in upside down or break by bending. They should have moved to usb-c. Other than that, great product for the price"
"It's ok The reviews are good. It is a Xmas gift, so the person receiving it has not tried it."
Kindle FIRE! Love it! Brought it for a gift for myself.. I'm really enjoying it! Great price too!
Kindles best I recently purchased the Kindle Fire 8 to replace a lost Kindle HD. The Fire 8 is an excellent upgrade and much better than the HD. The Fire 8 was recommended by one of the Best Buy staff that was very knowledgeable on the product. I highly recommend the Fire 8 and Best Buy
"Like the size of the 8 inch model Very comfortable and easy to use. Has plenty of storage for my usage. I mainly use it for books, internet and old school games( solitair, sodium and crossword puzzles."
Love it I am so happy I bought this. Just enough for surfing and reading. Took it on vacation. Nice to be able to check on things and to get info on the area you are visiting without having to take a laptop. Best purchase. Great price.
"Love It I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Great value, and easy to use!"
Love it Love the fire hd but I returned this for the 32gb.
Love it! This is my first kindle or fire or even an ereader but I love it! I can't put it down!
"Love it! Great gift idea. Bought the Fire 8"" tablet for a birthday gift and my grandson loves it. It was a replacement for his old Apple I pad, what a difference. The price was great, super long battery life, and display screen is incredible. He loves it!"
love it. replaced am earlier version of kindle. not disappointed at all.
"Love that they come in colors Great product for my kids, hours of entertainment!"
Love the design Just love the looks of the products and the pricing was great.
"Multipurpose on the go For reading books, downloading apps and having something convenient to travel with, very good bang for your buck!"
Nice This little tablet has fast speed and a long battery life. A great buy for the money.
Nice and compact The HD tablet is just right for a child who is being introduced to the computer word.
Nice graphics Perfect price with great clarity for a tablet without having to pay a lot like an I-Pad.
Nice product Is an awesome tablet with plenty of features that made for a perfect gift.
Not so good screen resolution Good for reading but video quality is not so good.
Not to be modified I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.
"Perfect for my kids I bought two of these for my kids, and they love them. They are responsive, durable, and inexpensive. Of course, whether it works for you depends on your usage scenario. If you are looking for a full-featured tablet computer to use for content creation, serious research, or other work-related tasks, you should look at an iPad Pro. But if you are looking for a device for games, entertainment, casual reading, and consuming Amazon content, this device works great. If you're looking for something for your kids and don't want to shell out $350 or more for an iPad, I'd strongly recommend checking this Kindle Fire out. We replaced two cracked screen iPads, and my kids haven't missed a beat with these."
"Perfect tablet for grandchild Grandchild is exploring and learning so much, having fun"
Purchased for granddaughter. She loves it and will use it for many different ways.
Replacement for older I love kindle. Best value for money. Replacing my older model with the 8in. Like that it is expandable as I ran out of space on other one.
So far so good This was to replace an earlier gen Kindle. That one would just shut down. We have not had any concerns with this and I will say I like the design better.
"Super little item I bought this tablet, so I can watch movies while waiting for my wife when she goes to her doctor, I love the fact that it links up with my Lenovo with no problems.Strong yes to this product"
Tablet purchase Worked well as expected. I would recommend this product.
"The Fire is hot after downloading the Nook app, I now have both a kindle reader and Nook reader in the same device"
time a read this item is very conv. for the time to read a good book or just to let the book read to you.
"What you‚Äôd expect Got this item as a gift, receiver was very happy with it!"
Wonderful tablet I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.
"Works well The Kindle Fire works well and I enjoy reading on it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems silly to restrict people from reading Nook books on it just because it is a different platform. As a book lover, I like supporting bookstores not only the almighty Amazon. Yes, I know there are ways to get around the restriction. The reason to reduce a point is not based on the excellence of this Kindle, but on politics of sharing."
"Wow, Love My Amazon Fire HD!! Wow, I love my Amazon Fire HD 16 GB in black. It is just the right size, and works perfectly. Loved it so much, I ordered 2 more for my grandchildren, in Marine Blue and Punch Red. I am totally satisfied!"
Xmas Gift My granddaughter always wanted to use my Kindle to watch netflix movies on or play games. This way she has her own and we each can enjoy.
2 year old granddaughter loves this FIRE! Purchase this Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition for my 2 year old grand daughter. She can watch her kid's videos now on her own device. She is learning to pick the videos she wants to watch. Her parents love it as well. Now it frees up their smart phones for their use.
"3 year old loves it I purchased the 7"" for my son when he was 1.5 years old, that one broke and while waiting for the replacement they came out with a 16gb version which I got him, he loved it. I now just saw the 8"" with stereo and more memory. He is almost 3, and plays a lot of learning games, for numbers letters, puzzles and more. Remember this is for kids, and things like Alexa are not important and I don't want my kid having that option anyway."
"3 yrs old loves it This tablet with the lesser price tag than a appple ipad is far less worry fora 3 yr old to have and own to watch with you while you both are together on the couch at night, a must for a first time tablet owner who has a young child. Who‚Äôs addicted to your own apple tablet."
"A beginners tablet for kids I have been wanting to get a tablet for my grandson. However his mother insisted on waiting till he was older. Recently he has been talking a lot more and my daughter said that if I wanted to buy the kids kindle for him. Its a great tool since he has the kindle unlimited free time he has learnered shapes, basic colors, words, puzzles, numbers, sorting, and even sequencing. Money well spent my grandson loves it."

A budget This tablet offers so much fun for what I expected
A good gift for a child Was a gift for the children at another home as I have no children.A great suggested gift. He is enjoying it. The grand parents have put some controls on it. A good tablet for the other home.
A Good Price and Great Value This is a good product at a great price if you are needing a tablet for web surfing.
a good product every time amazon updates there old to new the devices get better.
A great tablet at a fraction of the cost of a iPad Bought one for my mother and sister in law. Easy set up!
"A great tablet for beginners and Amazon fans This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
A great tablet for my daughter. My daughter said she really like her table. She can do her homework and school work on it. Also she do other things on it to.
A Keeper Great specs and kids zone. Fast and easy to set up and use.
"A lot of entertainment for the money This was purchased to give as a Christmas gift. It's no iPad, of course, but that's not really the idea. It's a strong performer for the money and, in our case, allowed an Amazon Prime member, who didn't have a tablet, to enjoy some entertainment when traveling or hanging around the house for the first time. Made a great gift, he's very pleased."
"A must-have for kids. A perfect tablet for kids. The parental controls allow only age appropriate content and are customizable without spending hours digging through the settings. It comes with a 2-year no questions asked ADH warranty from Amazon, making the geek squad protection on this device irrelevant. It also comes with a free, 1-year subscription to amazon kids allowing unlimited access to almost any children‚Äôs show and apps (that are normally paid for)."

"A ok tablet in a good price If you get it on a sale, it will be great deal. The tablet itself is simple, but very reliable."
"A perfect device for everyone A perfect device, can be do easily do everything and good for reading tooo."
"A Perfect Fit The fire fits perfect into my hand. It is easy to navigate thru all the uses. I got hooked on the solitary game, can't put it down! Also,I get books from the library to read on Axis 360. I can get my emails and breaking news."
"A+ After having and using a couple 'cheaper' generic android tablets priced between 50-100$, all I can say is the fire tablet beats them without question in all aspects.. faster, better display, etc etc... We are prime members, so of course it is more geared towards those with prime/etc. However it was easy enuf to side load the play store and get the other apps I need. The generic tabs are getting tosed and I've already purchased a 2nd fire tab"
"A+ I got one for me and my grandma, it's easy enough she doesn't have to call me to figure something out!"
"Absolutely recommend I wanted a device solely for reading and streaming Netflix, no games or other Internet apps. This device is awesome, easy to use, has great battery life and doesn't have as many update or streaming issues as my last device. I highly recommend."
Affordable price Very easy for a small child to use. very kid friendly
Affordable tablet for my 11 year old I purchased for my daughters birthday. She loves it and spends hours playing her favorite games and looking up info for school.
Agreat learning tool Have enjoyed learning to use touch screan. Reading email from my chair is relaxing and time saving. So easy to use.
Always a great prodeuct form Amazon. I have always been pleased with Amazon Fire Tablets that I have brought in the past. They are fast and never have a problem connecting to the internet like a few others I have had. After trying another 1 this past year I finally decided to go to what worked best and that is the Amazon Fire. Just the best tablet I can always trust.
Amazing Got this for my son he loves it. Very easy to use durable and with a two year no questions ask warranty can't beat it

Amazing great deal Having the fire has solve the issue of me keeping books to collect dust now I have my books with me in my fire and everywhere I go I have them amazing loved it
"Amazing little tablet I purchased my Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 8"" - Tablet - 16GB 7th Generation, 2017 Release - Punch Red a little over 2 months ago to use while traveling from home to projects out of state and found that not only do I use it on the plane to watch movies, I use it to check Email, surf the web, listen to music, play games and just about everything I do on my phone except make calls. It is so easy to use, the picture is amazing and the cost was considerably less what the Galaxy 7"" table cost with all the extras I added into mine. Came with 16GB storage which I quickly expanded to 64 and added a cover to protect it. So far, I love this tablet and am so glad I decided on this over the Galaxy 7"" tablet."
"Amazing Tablet The HD display is absolutely gorgeous. Charging time is speedy, battery life is extended compared to the older generation tablets, and it's very user-friendly. Easy to learn and enjoyable!"
"Amazing Tablet at a Great Price! Got this on a Black Friday sale for less than $50. It does just about everything. Play games, internet surf, create documents, read books, takes pictures/videos, streams music and movies in HD; it evens talks to you with the Alexa feature. Expandable up to 256gb of memory. Very fast and reliable tablet. For the price, you will find no equal. I haven't even scratched the surface with everything that it can do. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the camera is only a 2mp resolution; which is surprising, considering they bothered to put a HD screen on the tablet."
Amazing tablet for price These new Kindle Fire HD‚Äôs are really impressive. They can do it all.
Amazing tablet! Bought this for myGirlfriend and she absolutely loves it! It's got built in Alexa also! Don't hesitate! Buy now!
AMAZING tablets! These tablets were a GREAT buy & the kids LOVE them!
"Amazing value! My wife bought the 7"" version for reading. After seeing how easy it was to add movies on an SD card I bought this one for myself."
Amazon Good product processor very fast. Screen can get a little smeary from fingerprint.
"Amazon - Fire HD 8 Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 7th Generationworking good, loved it."
"Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 7th Generation Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 7th Generationworking good, loved it."
"Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 8"" - Tablet Since this was a gift, I have been told that the devise is great and serves as a personal tablet and is very user-friendly and powerful."

"Amazon - Fire HD 8 - 8"" - Tablet - 32GB 7th Genera The 8-inch screen is easy on your eyes, and high-definition technology makes for crystal-clear viewing of streaming movies and television shows. The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet runs up to 12 hours per charge. Very good."
"Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition - 8"" - Tablet My grandson loves it and uses it all the time. Well worth the money."
Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition - Ok The looks and the screen of Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition are good. The navigation is sluggish when compared to apple and Samsung. The touch screen is not very responsive. Camera is not so good. Amazon should have done much better job to make it a better product to compete with Samsung and apple. Hope Amazon makes improvements. The cost is low and appreciate that. I would not recommend to someone who is looking for good product. I cost is the factor you can live with it.
"Amazon at discount price Got this on great sale, also used some BB points. Typical Amazon stuff, reliable and inexpensive"
amazon fire everything was as stated on their website. i am very satisfied.
Amazon FIRE I bought 5 Amazon Fire tablets for Christmas they all loved it! Only problem is I did not get myself one! I got a great deal on Black Friday otherwise no one would have gotten one.
Amazon Fire I love it. I would definitely recommend it. I plan to take it on my trip coming up so I can read my books.
Amazon fire 8 I love my Amazon Fire 8 tablet. So easy to download books and movies. Great for trips!
Amazon fire 8 hd Kids enjoying by using this tablet. It looks so pretty!!
"Amazon fire 8 kids tablet I love this tablet and so do my children! I have been wanting to get one for a couple years but never had any wifi to use it with all the features, and trust me i bought every other kids tablet there was along the way. My daughter will be 6 this year and this is easily her 10th tablet i got all the ones for kids with the pre loaded apps and learning games. From nabi to samsung kids tablets and everything in between. These are by far the best. Very easy to use and my daughter loves all the games on them she plays for hours and the battery lasts a long time too, all the other tablets battery would die after an hour! This one just keeps going! Even my 2 year old son cant get enough of the books and learning games. I also like that it comes with a free year of free time for kids and if it breaks for any reason within 2 years they will replace it. All the other tablets broke after only a year or less, just stop working or glitch out. Trust me this tablet us worth it! Give it a try! You wont be sorry."
Amazon Fire HD Love my current one hoping this is a little lighter
Amazon Fire HD 8 The daughter was surprised with the speed and ability of the Fire HD 8.She spends a lot of time on it and the battery life is good for the size of it.
"Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is great for adults too! The Kindle Fire HD 8 edition is just like the adult version except it comes withOUT the special offers (ads). It also includes a two-year warranty, one year of FreeTime, a protective case, and can be bought locally at Target. PIN protected accounts can be set up for adults and children. The Kindle Fire is designed to consume content including accessing Amazon services and content. A library of apps, books, music, videos, and more is available at your fingertips! For the kids, content is appropriate for their age level and screen time can be set. It just works! If you want more than that, the additional desired options do not just work out of the box. I am an older, non-traditional college student with children and some difficulty seeing. I prefer to buy my textbooks or check out books from the local library in the Kindle Edition. There are a lot of advantages to eBooks including being able to enlarge the font, multi-media elements, built-in dictionary, ability to extract notes, and some have text-to-speech. There are also no books to return or mail back. The Kindle Edition format works better with the actual reader instead of just the apps on an iPad, iPhone, or even computer--I have all these too. I need to be able to create content too and apps that may not be available through Amazon app store. A quick web search led me to instructions to install the four necessary files to have Google Play on this device (software version 5.6.1.0) with no root needed from a reputable source. I was now able to add the Microsoft Office apps, YouTube, VLC, a virus scanner, and some other favorites through the Google Play app. The SD card can be used for movies or music too for on the go where access to Wi-Fi may not be available. This part was easy. These apps can be copied over to the children's profiles too. It was a bit more complicated to do this because of the number of steps involved, and it takes a little more time and patience. Bluetooth allowed me to connect a keyboard (can add separately or buy a case/keyboard combo like one made by Fintie named Blade X1) and a mouse too turning it into a lightweight, inexpensive, functional, and portable device great for classes or on the go at a fraction of the cost for the least expensive iPad with a case and keyboard. It is no powerhouse tablet though. However, it does work much better than my under-powered netbooks that run Windows. I only installed the essentials and close the apps I am not using. Unless your child is responsible and careful, I think the charging of the device by an adult would eliminate many of the issues I have seen about it."
Amazon fire HD tablet Tablets are good in use and like the design convenient to use
"Amazon Fire HD tablet great buy The tablet is high quality and with the price under a hundred dollars, it is a great value. The screen size is 8"", which is just right for my use. I can use Alexa on it too."
"Amazon Fire is Top of the Line I had an old one that lasted forever!! I finally dropped it and it broke (about the zillionth time it had been dropped, egad!). This new one is awesome just like the old one and I love that you can buy colors now! We got blue. My son is busy playing with Alexa, since she wasn't on our previous tablet. :)"

Amazon Kindle Fire 8 I love my Kindle... It is great for reading my books and browsing the net and such
"Amazon plays with the Big Boys Although the Amazon Tablet has come along way from it's humble beginning as e-reader, it still feels like it needs more tweaking if it wants to stay in the ring with heavyweights like Microsoft, Samsung and Apple."
Amazon says it all Perfect gift idea. Alexa voice is a plus. Great tablet.
"Amazon tablet Bought for my 5year old daughter and it is perfect. You can set two profiles one as parent when has control over what apps can be made on your child's, also many free books instant download that is great for learning to read and even chapter books."
Amazon tablet for toddler Great tablet for toddlers. Been using it the last week. Put it on the front carseat headrest to keep them distracted while on the road.
"Amazon tablet is great Its great in everyway,, has so.mamy different games and movie choices"
"Amazon-Fire HD 8"" 32Gb Tablet This was for my granddaughter for her 6th birthday. She had quickly outgrown her other tablet although it was age appropriate. This tablet has enough storage space, especially when you add a micro-SD card, to allow downloading of apps. The operating system also permits downloading, which the earlier tablet did not permit. She is extremely happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet as is evidenced by the amount of time she spends using it."
Appears to be a good product; giving Fir Xmas Nothing further to Comment. Giving as a Xmas gift.
Apps are great for my daughter Have a special needs daughter who needs a tablet that is durable along with fun apps she can enjoy without having her mom checking on where she is surfing on the internet. Very entertaining without having her wonder on various apps.

Awesome for shows This is a great device for watching videos or reading books!
"Awesome for the price! There are better tablets out there, but not at this price point, and if you are a prime member it's a no brainer!"

"Awesome kids tablet I am 100% an apple person. I was always hating on Kindles due to them having a very limited AppStore. Once I found out how to get the google play store on the device, I fell in love. The kid version is 100% worth the extra money. It isn‚Äôt just the case that makes it more money, it comes with a year of freetime, which features awesome child appropriate shows, videos and apps. It also includes the two year worry free warranty! It is the only type of tablet I will be purchasing in the future. With iPads, you‚Äôre constantly terrified of them being dropped and cracking. Even if these crack, at least you have the warranty with no ridiculous deductible!"
Awesome little tablet! I bought five of these as Christmas gifts. They were hits with all the recipients! The longer battery life and reasonable price made these tablets the easy choices.

Awesome product I love my Fire. Lightweight and very easy to use!!
"Awesome quality tablet So glad I chose to buy this Kindie on BF. It is still a great price regardless for such a quality product. Made well, feels solid not cheap and chency. I love the blue that I got as well as the other color selections. Great job!"
Awesome Tablet Great for my Kindle books. 1080p makes movie watching enjoyable.
"Awesome tablet Great value. I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old so I needed a tablet that was indestructible. This tablet is extremely durable, fairly quick and the 1 year of Amazon Freetime is nice. You cannot break this tablet especially with the thick foam case that comes with it. If you want a tablet for your little ones that is indestructible, affordable, educational and has great parental features then this is what you are looking for. The only downside is the screen brightness could be a lot brighter."
Awesome tablet I bought this tablet as a gift and they really loved it.
Awesome Tablet I thought this tablet was awesome for the price. The screen was very vivid in its color. I think it was worth the price.
Awesome Tablet My daughter loves her tablet she takes it every where with her.

"Awesome Tablet This is an awesome tablet, Got on for my sister as a gift, she LOVES it."
Awesome Tablet This tablet exceeded my expectations. The price isn‚Äôt too bad either.
Awesome tablet This tablet is great. Love the ease of use and the display is vibrant
awesome tablet We have had a number of tablets but non of them have been as user friendly as this one. My son loves it and it is super easy for him to find his apps.

Awesome Tablet For Children! I love this Kindle Fire! It keeps my child occupied and learning and is very lightweight and durable. The protective rubber case that it came with is wonderful and absorbs falls etc. very well. I totally recommend buying one.
"Awesome tablet for my nephew! My soon to be wife and I decided to buy the tablet for our nephew for his birthday and he's in love with it. He's able to watch youtube and play games on it, doesn't hiccup or lag at all. A huge plus for me is the protective case it came with. With it being on sale at the time for around $100 for a 32GB tablet - that was a no brainer. Definitely worth every penny."

AWESOME tablet! I love this tablet. Very responsive and fast for a cheap tablet. just the right size! I bought 2 of them! the battery last a long time also! HIGHLY recommend it! It has Alexa built into it also!
"Awesome tablet! This thing is great the display is incredibly sharp. My wife has gone thru 5 tablets and 3 cellphones in the last 2years. She loves the fire hd 8. The battery lasts her all day and she's on it alot. Easily navigated and VERY user-friendly. Would definitely recommend this to family and friends, even complete strangers! The only complaint....screen share or mirroring needs to be included in the features. Otherwise AWESOME TABLET!!!!!!"
Awesome toy My daughter made me buy this tablet and I‚Äôm glad I did
Awesome XD Very simple to use and does everything I need it to....nice XD
Awesome! I bought this for my wife so she could get internet access and check mail without having to leave the room. She loves it and is totally hooked on it! The price was good as well.
Awsome for my niece My niece absolutely loves this plus all the in house benefits provided by Amazon u cant lose best bang for your buck when spending on a 12 year old . great for her school and entertainment . Amazon does it again
"Beginners tablet This is a good tablet for internet, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu and email. Only complaints are the locked screen wallpaper is an ad and the screen is not as bright as an iPad but a winner for the price."
Best buy we got for our daughter Our 1 1/2 year old daughter loves this one and she is very delighted with this one

"Best cheap tablet This tablet has everything you need. Sturdy enough and a very nice (not iPad like... but just what you need) resolution for movies or whatever you'd like to see. There are not may apps on the Amazon store... but my basics for reading, entertaining my son, bed series/movies preview, internet surfing and the baseline apps such as Gmail, Hotmail, banks and so on.... this is a very good product for the price!!!!"
"Best daily on the go tablet Use for reading easier to hold than 10"" . Works well for Facebook and surfuring."
Best device A real good device great size screen with a clear picture the price was very reasonable i wil surel use it alot
Best for the price Gift to my sister and she is loving it. It was a sweet deal!!
Best gift Bought this for my 4 yr old grandson. He loves it. Maybe too much!
"Best gift ever Got a fantastic deal on Black Friday. We have owned iPads for years as well as eReaders. My dad used an older Kindle ereader but never one of the family tablets. Even so, I decided for this deal price to get him his own Kindle Fire, as well as the Fire case and a tempered glass screen protector. I got a 64gb micro sd and set it all up with his books and favorite news sites and apps he would use, and re boxed it up as a gift. Well 5 months have passed and he has not put it down! He loves it! He reads his books, surfs and has become a news hound. Suddenly we have all sorts of political discussions haha - good thing we are on the same page for the most part. It‚Äôs great that he reads so much and has this as a hobby now that he is retired. What a fabulous gift this turned out to be. It‚Äôs pretty easy for him to use even though he was used to Apple devices. He rarely has questions and just loves streaming video to the Chromecast, reading the news and has burned through a lot of novels. No complaints. I highly recommend this for the price, compared to my iPad that cost hundreds more."
Best kid tablet I love this tablet!! I love that I can set limits for my daughter. She loves the tablet enjoys every single app on it
"Best life investment into grandkids future. Portable, durable, strong battery life and it came with 13k in education programs. Both children are proud and showing do much responsibility by taking care of there tablet. They have designed their own schedule. Am very happy for them both. Best investment ever."
Best product from bestbuy Bestbuy is always on top of any other brands interms of offer and quality of product as always
Best tab at low cost Best tab at low cost. Best features. Good Amazon apps.
"Best tablet I give this as many stars as possible, I recently bought this tablet for my kids to share which I can create their own profile with each their own apps. I also have a parent profile which allows me to download apps for my kids which syncs to their profile . I can view which apps they've used and how long they been on the tablet for . I can also time the tablet for them since I don't want them stuck on the tablet all day. It's just like a regular tablet with YouTube and Web . Except it's so much easier for kids to use ! And comes with a kid friendly case ! Think of it like a cellphone that you let your kids borrow while you get things done around the house , except kids probably click on something else by accident and takes them to an ad which kids hate and mostly throw the phone to the floor . Well this tablet shows the apps, movies and books making it easier for kids to handle without worrying about them clicking something else by accident .It also blocks ads from the applications/games and doesn't let them click on tokens you can purchase with debit card etc.. This has such great quality videos! Very fast and a great amount of volume !!! I love this tablet and recommend it to anyone that has kids !!!"
"Best tablet for 5-8 year old girls. I bought this tablet for my 3rd grader, she loves it! She will be on it for hours at a time, there's a feature that allows me to put time limits which I love. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes the filtered content doesn't have a lot of options. However, I would buy again."

"Best tablet for a kid These tablets are nearly indestructible! This is my sons second one but his first lasted almost 2 years of falls, throws, spilled drinks, etc. If they can last through my sons rough use then they can last for anyone."
"Best tablet for price This tablet was the perfect gift for my husband who didn‚Äôt really need one, but enjoyed getting one as a gift to do things like watch movies and play games on. It‚Äôs the most affordable tablet with the functionalities he needs. No need to spend hundreds of dollars on another tablet that does the same thing!"
"Best Tablet for the money I had the Fire 7 at first but the speakers werent loud enough. Took it back and got the Fire 8.Was a nightmare to try and get the internet to work. Spent 12 hrs trying..gave up and returned it. Got another one and it worked great. The first one had issues. Nice clear screen, very fast and easy to use. The sale price was a super buy for $49 (reg $79).You wouldn't go wrong buying this tablet."
Best tablet for the price This is the best tablet for the price. If you have amazon prime then it's that much better. Who doesn't use amazon nowadays anyway?
Best warranty hands down Unlimited no questions asked warranty replacement. It‚Äôs a no brainer for a child!
Better Kindle and more versatile! Wanted a bigger Kindle with color. With the faster speed I can now stream movies too.
"Better Storage but not better speakers I love my new Kindle the screen is great and I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more storage. However, the speaker sounds like mono instead of stereo. The sound is loud and clear but it would have been great if they had a speaker on each side of the Kindle."
Better tables than before Thanks for delivering on-time because I had to get it fast.
Better than our previous Amazon tablet Purchased as an X-mas gift for my 5 y/o son and he definitely loves this tablet. Great built-in parental controls that enable us to control daily usage time and content.
Big hit with the preteens! Easy set-up with simple parental control. Nice product at a great price. Bought six of them for gifts. Big hit!
"Big screen I was able to upgrade from the 7"" tablet to the 8"" and my kids love it. The best part of it is the durable case! When I went in to the store to exchange it (the SD card slot was no longer picking up the SD card), I took it out of the case and was so surprised at how it had no dents and stuff marks. It looked brand new after 2 years (I purchased a screen protector). Would recommend to kids of any age."
"Bit slow and occasionally glitchy, but still good Definitely takes a few seconds for it to catch up with the user (especially in displaying apps after pressing the home button), but overall a good product for the price."
Black Friday special Great buy for the money! 16 G will work well for business
"Black Friday Special Great screen, many free apps and games on Amazon, Kindle reader, and virus protection."
Bought for 10 year old Very happy with this purchase..thw kid has dropped it no less than 39383 times and no screen cracks

Bought it for Grandma She loves it! Very easy to use and a great deal when I bought it.
Bought it for my niece I like that it can be used as a regular tablet but also have a separate account for my niece where she can‚Äôt get into anything crazy.
"breaks easily I have always bought nabi's they have lasted for a couple of years with my grandkids This item I bought for my six year old grandson as an upgrade (his nabi lasted 26 months) This broke in two days after giving it to him, It would not charge and the LCD went out . I am now having to jump through hoops to get it replaced ."

"Budget friendly and Capable Tablet I bought 2 of these tablets for my younger cousins. One of them is a toddler and it was perfect for child friendly and educational apps. The screen is great as well, perfect for viewing downloaded and streamed content."
Budget tablet Excellent tablet for the price. Use it mainly for watching Amazon Prime movies etc. Would not recommend for heavy gaming. Just a fun tablet for the money.
"Budget Tablet I got it on a offer. For the price I paid, I'm not complaining. It does its work, not the fastest but it should do it."
Built in programming is wonderful Love the ease of using parental controls and adding new programming. And Grandson loves it.

But one I love this kindle this is just as good as any tablet. I have had several tablets and i would recommend this one over any of them.
Buy one Loved this product. Easy to use and so many ways to use. My niece down loaded movies from Netflix to watch on her band trip. Her iPhone runs out of battery so quickly. This battery lasted a round trip and she shared with friends.
Can't beat for price Gave to father for Xmas. Was up and running in no time. $50 can't beat it.
"can't beat it, for the price it works well, my only real gripe is that you're limited to the Amazon store for apps and some apps aren't the real provider, but a 3rd party app that is...hokey. Other than that for $50 I can't complain."
"can't beat the price can't beat the price I bought this at from Best Buy. It has held up well inside the beefy case we bought for it, and the screen is nice and sharp. However, the unit did randomly shut off and refuses to power back up without ever coming into contact with water or any drops. I am glad that the replacement plan was very affordable."
Can't beat the price. Got these for the grandkids for Christmas. They loved them!
"Can't beat the price. This tablet is great if you have Amazon Prime. You really cant beat it for the price. I also have the 7"" version."
"Cheap and Great Amazon Fire tablets are amazing. The best aspect is their price, but the little detail that prevents it from being perfect is the lack of the Google Play Store. Amazon App Store does a good job, but there are some apps that are still unavailable."
cheap tablet! I purchased it for nephew loved it was cool. I didn't want to get tablet expensive can break damage. its not easy for kids. I installed google play store worked on Amazon. it did! cool!
Cheaper Alternative to Ipad Amazon Fire was a cheaper alternative to buying ipad. It works pretty well and served its purpose. My wife enjoys using it.
Child loves this He is an Apple lover but the fact that you can download things for when you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi is the big winner! He‚Äôs grown to love it !
Christmas I got 3 for my kids for Christmas which they have yet to be open but got them on black Friday so the price was right

"Christmas gift Can't wait to give to my son for Christmas! He's going to be so excited, great buy!"
Christmas Gift My granddaughter seems very pleased with it. I know little about these things myself . Her parents are tech savy and they are impressed with it.
Christmas Gift Purchased 3 as gifts for grandchildren and they are a big hit already.
Christmas gift for my kid We bought this for Christmas for our girl. I went to the store but they didn‚Äôt have yellow one which I like the most. I thought the coloer doesn‚Äôt specify girls or boys so we can maybe use for our second one!!!
Christmas gifts I‚Äôve used one on multiple occasions. They seem to user friendly so I bought 3 of them for Christmas gifts for my nieces and son.
Christmas present I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. It was easy working with the employee of Best Buy.
Come with ads on homesceeen This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising
Compact Purchased Kindled in the past and love their ease of use and size.
Compared to IPad Not too bad. More freedom to do what you want. Expandable memory. Way better than the previous version. Major upgrade. Of coarse it‚Äôs not going to be as smooth as an operating system from Apple but for the cost difference you‚Äôre better off going with this.
"Convenient size I have the Kindle HD7 but wanted something between it and a 10"" tablet.The Bluetooth function lets you use a wireless keyboard, which makes things easier than typing on the screen."
"Convenient tablet If you are looking for an easy-to-use tablet, this Fire 8 delivers! I use it for music while working out and it has many other functions that not many people know about. I like to use it as a second monitor while using my computer and I can monitor my house. Since I do not have a smart phone, this helps me out a lot."
Cool kids gadet This item was for my 5 year old he loves it he's able to rent books from library surf web and play games a parents dream
Cool tablet Well I still haven‚Äôt got the hang it of it. But so far it‚Äôs cool.
"Could be better My wife has the Samsung tablet and has better access to games. I can't get the same games on my new Amazon Fire, but in general the quality is top notch - the inability to load apps desired is disappointing."
"Couldnt go without it Gave this as a Christmas gift to an older woman, very user friendly she loves it"
Daughter loves it My 3 year old loves it. Several learning apps and can keep children entertained for several hours
Daughter loves it Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. $129.99 and even got a price adjustment once it went it sale.

Daughter Loves it! This was such a great gift for my daughter! She was so excited to get it! Great screen color and the rubber grip is awesome!
"daughter loving it Great device with more space than previous models. Screen is brilliant and memory is expandable now. Oh yea, and my daughter loves it."
"Decent For the price, you can't beat this tablet it's a little slow, the camera is not great, but otherwise works good. The only thing is that it has ads, that you have to pay $15 to Amazon to remove...."
"Decent book reader Great for the price, lots of functionality.recommend for the avid ebook reader"
Decent mid size tablet Everything worked well and a little faster than the 7 inch but a little harder to hold with one hand. Ended up returning and keeping the 7 inch tablet instead as it was better for me. Still a great deal
Decent tablet for a decent price While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags. I've watched movies on this from my Amazon prime account and have read my books from my Kindle account and everything works well. It's not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner!
"Decent tablet for the money I bought this for my son and he likes it. It is directed for everything Amazon so no Play Store, etc.. but he does like the fact that it can be locked in landscape and portrait mode."
"Decent tablet, HORRIBLE warranty Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way"
"Decent tablet, HORRIBLE warranty Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way"
Decent value for good tablet This was purchased for a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves being able to read her books on the device as well as being able to use Alexa. Very pleased with it.
Dependable tablet I bought this tablet coz of its cheap price compared to the other stores.
Does the job Everything I needed basic web surfing Netflix hbo.
"Does what I want at a decent price. I didn't need a tablet all that much but I kind of wanted it to take notes, read some comics and keep some documents on and this does all of this quite well. Skype works great on it and I found decent cheap programs to transcribe handwriting into text."
Does what I was looking for Bought this to put away for a Christmas gift for someone who loves to read and a side of games bonus. The size is perfect for both. The color is sharp and it does just what I was looking for at a great price.
Doesn't support youtube red video downloads I bought this tablet to download videos from youtube red and to be able to take the tablet everyone we travel to play the videos. But unfortunately this tablet model does not support youtube red and it definitely doesn't work without wifi. So that was a fail! I'm gonna need to figure out how to download stuff so we can run the tablet without being connected to wifi. Other then that it's good for your little ones older then 3 or 4 years of age. It's big so they might have trouble holding it up but if they sit down with it then all the apps help promotes them to keep engaged and interested to sit still. Great case protector!
"Doesn't work for me This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I've probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It's going back if they'll take it."
"Doesn't work. I'm sure its a great product but there was something wrong with the one I ordered on target.com. My daughter opened it on Christmas morning and was so excited. We went to charge it and it wouldn't turn on. We tried holding the power button down for 40 seconds like the amazon website suggests, nothing, we left it charging for hours and still nothing. Very disappointed."
Durable Love how durable this is. Works fast and makes gameplay fun. Wish Google play was on this.
Durable and easy to use tablet My three year old daughter loves this. It pairs nicely with our Amazon account and allows her to see our full video library. Storage is expandable. Guaranteed from breakage. Works well as and iPad alternative for the adults too.
Easy set up Easy to use. Battery life is great. I got this as a gift for someone and have heard nothing but good things about it.
easy setup Tablet was easy to setup I was offered free setup but didn't need it.
easy to use All of the Amazon apps were preloaded which was a plus. I LOVE the Alexa app. This was helpful when I couldn't find Netflix in the apps.
Easy to use Bought this for my 1year 7 months he loves it so much
Easy to use Bought this for my 1year 7 months he loves it so much
Easy to use Gift for Nana. She said it was so easy to set up. Picture is great. Also it is much faster than her older model!
Easy to use Got this for my young grandchildren. I choose the fire 7 and not the kids version
"Easy to use I bought this for my 2 year old since he kept fighting with his sisters over the iPads. This is a great alternative to those and cost much less. 12 months of freetime is great and then prime members get a big discount to continue to the service after the 12 free months. The build quality is great and the free child bumper works great as well. This also comes with a free 2 year warranty from Amazon so you have a piece of mind in case your kid breaks it, which will be hard to do with the included bumper. Great product!"
"easy to use Just started to use the tablet and it seems very sturdy, easy to use and does everything I need and more. Considering I am not very tech savvy this product is perfect."
"Easy to use Purchased for my sister, tablet novice.Easy setup, good screen brightness. Good for Internet browsing. Good beginner tablet"
Easy to use Very easy to set limits for the kids and the apps are very accessible for them. The sd card slot is a huge bonus.
Easy to use Works great. Was able to transfer all my books from my old one
Easy to use Worth the price. Added this to my collection mainly for audible books. Don‚Äôt like the OS much.
"Easy to use but limited Easy to use but more limited than a more powerful tablet such as a Galaxy or iPad. Video conferencing is rather difficult to do in my experience. However if you read digital books, watch videos, or listen to music it works well and the stereo sound with the larger versions is really nice."
"Easy to use for anyone I love my new Kindle, it's easy to use. It was very easy to get started, I downloaded everything from my old Kindle Fire and was ready to go in a very short amount of time."
Easy to use tablet nice size tablet with a good protective case that is easy to hold onto
Easy to use Tablet This table this the perfect size.I can carry it any where.
"Easy to use! I must say this is so easy to use and convenient and so portable. If you need to entertain kids during appointments, etc., it would definitely be handy!"
Easy to use! Much better than my older Kindel. This is my third Kindel. They just keep getting better.
Easy to use. Nice to look at. Easy to use. Decent price.sceen has decent resolution.
Ebooks I love to read but am running out of space to store my books so I decided to try out the kindle. Love it and spend hours reading. I have a Prime account and love getting my free books ever month.
"Eventually a good buy. 3 yr old loves it, I hate it. Hours spent download"
"Excelent product I like so much this item, I will recommend this to my friends"
"Excellence in Simplicity The tablet is pretty basic, but there is a lot to be said for that. Excellence in simplicity. Very long battery life. Exceeds my expectations."
Excellent Excellent new features and the color is great!! Buy it
"Excellent I had been looking for a smaller tablet. The new Fire HD8 is the perfect fit. It's great for media of all types. It's even a pretty good gaming device. But keep your expectations in check. It won't do everything a full laptop can, but it's not supposed to. The screen is terrific, although you may need to download an app for white balance adjustment."
EXCELLENT I WAS LOOKING FOR A TABLET FOR MY GRAN DAUGHTER AND FOUND THIS
Excellent My girlfriend loves using this product. She uses it every day.
Excellent Nice size screen. Very clear picture. The blue color tablet looks very nice. Overall satisfied.
"Excellent The item is excellent, the price, the store, and the agents that assisted me"
"Excellent The item was excellent ,best price,best cost and best store"
Excellent This is a perfect tablet for kids between age of 4-12 if you have amazon prime you can download games for free also is good for traveling.
"Excellent This is a very nice tablet. Screen size is sufficient, ample storage, and sound is very good. Would buy again."
"Excellent device Great tablet for toddlers, price is very affordable and it design gets a feeling of unbreakable hard tablet."
"Excellent for all Crisp color, great performance, with all the great apps. Excellent for reading with the reduced glare feature. The screen size and HD clarity makes it optimal for viewing shows and movies."
"Excellent for kids! I was contemplating if I should me buy the regular tablet or the specific one for kids. And I recommend if it's going to be used by kids a lot, better buy the kids version. You get 1 year subscription of unlimited entertainment and learning stuff and many of the best stuff is already available. No need to go to the app site and think of what to download. It's a major benefit."

Excellent for reading books This tablet is adicting and easy to youse incredibly fast clear screen in any light and is so easy to order and return books i never have to go to a book store
"Excellent For The Most Part This is an excellent tablet for children and adults. Runs great and looks fine. While it may not pack the punch that newer iPads and Android Tablets do, the Amazon Fire HD does everything you expect it to. Bought one for my daughter and she absolutely loves it."
excellent kids tablet We chose this tablet specifically for the parental controls and it does not disappoint. I really appreciate the fact that I don't have to worry about the kids getting into and changing settings or coming across inappropriate content. Normally we choose apple products so I was a little worried about this platform but I'm thrilled with this purchase.
Excellent Kindle Best Kindle Fire I have ever had and this is my fourth one. Had a regular Kindle when they first came out. Upgraded to a Fire 7 and now to the Fire 8.
Excellent parental control We were shopping for a tablet for our 7 year-old daughter. We checked out numerous tablets but ultimately chose the Kindle based on the ability to control it very easily.
Excellent price I had been looking at the Fire tablet for quite some time and at the price I just could not pass it up.
"Excellent product Bought this for trip, works great long battery life with lots of apps for the kids."
"Excellent product Bought this for trip, works great long battery life with lots of apps for the kids."
"Excellent product I have 3 other kindle tablets for my grandkids. Got this one for my mom, but she decided not to keep it, so I have it. It's excellent as a book and as a tablet. I especially like the blue screen feature, which cuts down greatly on eye strain."
Excellent Product I read a lot of digital comic books and graphic novels. I wanted to get a cheap tablet just for that purpose.it does a wonderful job
Excellent product for 8 y/o Great app selection. Parental controls are easy to set up to prevent unwanted purchases. The fact that the bumper is already included is a plus and protects it well.
Excellent products I enjoy shopping at best buy stores. Best buy has the best prices and quality of merchandise.
"Excellent products for my two grandsons! I love Best Buy; I wouldn't think of going elsewhere for my electronics. I don't believe their prices can be beat, and they stand behind their products."
"Excellent starter technology for young users Easy, friendly features that allows for uncomplicated use and function."
Excellent tablet Amazon Fire Tablet is a top tier product. Must buy
"Excellent Tablet I love the Fire tablets. They are cheap and very high-quality products! Great battery life, High Definition, and also could expand the memory storage."
"Excellent Tablet Purchased 4 of these tablets as Xmas gifts and the interface is perfect.What a great deal for $50 8gig version.Wife was so intrigued by Alexa voice,now she wants one.The best tablet deal I ever purchased."
excellent tablet This is the second tablet I have purchased (the latest is a gift for a family member). These tablets are great and you cannot beat the price. I use mine daily and it goes every where with me. I highly recommend purchasing one.
"Excellent Tablet This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review."
Excellent Tablet at a price too good to pass up I bought two of these tablets for my kids as Christmas presents. They had older Kindle tablets and the Black Friday price was too good to pass up. They seem to be faster and the display is much brighter than their older devices.
Excellent tablet for any user This tablet is definitely worth every dollar. Extremely well priced and very easy to use and download items or apps.
Excellent tablet for its price This is a great tablet for the price. Only caveat is the amazon ads that come with it.
Excellent tablet for the Money You won‚Äôt get a better one at this price and it makes it more compelling with the built in Alexa voice assistant.
"Excellent tablet overall Since I bought this tablet, I have not been able to find any major faults with it at all! Its 8"" display allows it to be quite portable while allowing the screen to be large enough for me to watch movies on it. The device has a Micro SD port on the side, which allows you to extend its internal memory. One slight disadvantage is that it runs on Fire OS 5, and although it is a variant of Android, you are limited to the apps available for download and installation through Amazon's Appstore as the Google Play Store app is not present on the tablet."
"Excellent tablet. Very sleek. I love the Amazon fire. It is very user friendly. It's great for reading books, streaming music, and watching movies."
Excellent upgrade- super graphics Upgraded after older version slowed. Excellent graphics and speed. Look forward to learning more about newer features.
"Excellent value I bought this as a book reader but found that it does so much more that I find myself using it everywhere. the price of this unit is lower because of the startup ads but that is not an issue at all. when you turn it on the ""swipe to start"" screen is an ad instead of just a blank screen, so what? it's targeted advertising and some are quite interesting."
Exceptional tablet Great item and a great price. A gift for my sister that I'm sure she will enjoy
"Fair table, great price Decent tablet for the price it offers, good deal I‚Äôd say."
"False advertising?? Received the Amazon Fire HD8 and it works well, BUT it is clogged up with constant ads. I had to contact Amazon to turn them off, at an additional cost of $15+tax.. When promoting this item at this price, it should have a notice that the price is discounted by the inclusion of constant ads!"
Family tested We have been long time uses of Kindles. This new Kindle fire replaced one I've had for years. And I gotta say I love the new apps it's been upgraded with! There's more we can do with it and I use it daily. My son has the free time kid's membership for $3/month for age appropriate content.
Fantastic for on the go After I learned how to use the Fire it is fantastic. Easy to use and fun.
"Fantastic for the price! Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough? Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my $900 smartphone, $1000 laptop and $500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem. When it is it's very annoying.Screen is meh. It's good enough to not be a bother but coming from a 4k laptop and AMOLED display on my Google pixel XL, the screen is lacking. To the standard user, I don't think it will be noticeable though, and looks pretty good.Case and screen protector selection are sad and limited. Hopefully that changes soon as this tablet was just released this month.Cameras are useless. Not what I bought the tablet for so it didn't bother me one bit, but don't buy it for the cameras, a potato could take better photos.CONCLUSION:So overall I adore this tablet. I use it every day and now that I can have my Google apps and such on it, it is a fully functional Android tablet. It's wonderful, suits my needs, and hasn't disappointed me yet. Highly recommend."
"Fantastic Value This little tablet was purchased during a moment of weakness. I really wanted a Kindle reader. But this has exceeded my needs for a fraction of the price. I can read and listen to books PLUS a ton of other things (including browse on wifi). The ""offers"" show as lock screens and notifications and can be ignored or dismissed easily and make the device price of under $50 (during a promo) very reasonable! Speed is decent, storage upgradable with MicroSD, and feels like a book in a folio-style case. PERFECT! Note: I have other higher-end productivity tablet devices, also. This WILL NOT replace them or do all they can do. Entertainment, internet browsing and leisure is what this was purchased for and I'm pleased."
Fast Had to have my son set up the tablet took about 30 mins
Fast and easy This is really easy to use no complications so far and it's really fast.
Fast and works great. It is a great buy. Nice quality.Enjoy playing music and emailing at the sametime.
"Fast app download easy navigation Good price for the buy , I use it mostly to play games. Only downside is Amazon app store doesn't have as many games as Google play. And you can't get Google chrome app either."
Faulty It already quit working. Will not charge anymore. I had to buy a new one.
Fire This fire was for my 78 year old grandfather-in-law. He loves it. He can see it. It's easy to use!
Fire 8 Fast inexpensive tablet. Great deal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Fire 8 Tablet Is Excellent This is a great tool for both listening to music and for reading, as well as watching videos. I think it's a great improvement on the 7 just in terms of screen size and handling. Very easy to set up and use."
"Fire 8"" tablet It's a great tablet for my grandson. it has plenty of storage for his favorite games and books. I also enjoy the parental settings, so that I can see everything he is doing and set time limits for him. Overall it was a great buyand the pricing way awesome!"
"Fire HD Great unit . Computer died so I got this , works great . Does everything I need . Need to set up remote printer app. Yet"
Fire HD 8 Screen size is perfect and it does everything I/we need it to do.

fire hd tablet I'm really impressed with Amazon products my son really happy..
fire hd tablet I'm really impressed with Amazon products my son really happy..
Fire Kindle tablet This was the best deal ever and it also came with antivirus service.
"Fire OS is still Android. So my son broke my (his) old Samsung tablet that he'd been using for himself since his older brother had an iPad. I immediately thought of the fire kids edition and knew it would be good for him since it's still Android and since it's a very simple fix to get all of his favorite apps on it. A word of advice: Fire OS is very limited, but with a few downloads you can easily bypass the fire OS launcher and even install google services. Battery life is very good, and with the included case now I'm not afraid of another accidental drop. It can handle any of his kids games and with both the Amazon app store AND the play store the possibilities are endless."

Fire tablet My husband loves the tablet it works great and I bought it for him
Fire Tablet is a great tablet. I really like my fire tablet. I bought my Mom one when her kindle was acting up and not working. I bought myself one and really like it for the price. It's not expensive and works great. I use mine mainly to read on and added more storage to it.
"Fits my needs perfectly I wanted a device to browse content in a screen bigger than a smart phone, read e books and watch videos. Being cheaper, coming from a renowned brand, the latest 2017 Fire HD 8 had improved screen, memory, battery compared to its predecessor. Also, I found a way to install Google play store and use this as a normal Android tablet. Here's the link - https://www.howtogeek.com/232726/how-to-install-the-google-play-store-on-your-amazon-fire-tablet/.The device runs smoothly so far after installing all my fav apps."
"Five stars Love this tablet. I bought it while it was on sale 99 as a Christmas present for my 4 year old. Plus with my red card i saved an additional 5.. It is so nice and easy to use. I love the case it comes in too! My other son has an iPad mini I added to my phone plan, and i like this way better. It comes with apps, books, games and movies and is educational as well as fun. Very happy with this purchase would definitely recommend."
Food for beginner Easy to use for kids as a beginner. Plus it's already got a case on it!

Fun! My brother and I are having so much fun with this!
Game Changer Purchased this for my son to carry to class instead of laptop. This has been much more convenient and enable him to utilize online textbooks instead of purchasing/renting expensive course material.
Gave as a gift Gave it as a gift to my mom for Christmas. She‚Äôs not into new tech. But after three weeks she loves it!
GD TABLET The purchase of this tablet is sufficient for my granddaughters needs
GD TABLET The purchase of this tablet is sufficient for my granddaughters needs
Gets the job done These were bought as gifts for elementary age kids. It is a great tablet which also gives the kids ability to download books to the Kindle app.
Gets the Job Done This little tablet gets the job done. Plenty of functionality. Attractive and priced right.
Gift This was purchased as a gift so I can only offer an average expectation of its performance.
Gift for 6 year old niece She loved it! Perfect for viewing movies and playing games!
Gift for mom Easy to use. Gift for 86 year old mom who loves to read. She needed a bigger screen. Will enjoy other abilities of tablet.
Gift for Mom. Great!! Replaced older Kindle. Much better version!
"Gift for my GF My girlfriend has been wanting an e-reader for a while now. She reads rather quickly, so she wants to have the option of taking more than one book with her. Got her this, loaded up her Amazon library, and she hadn't put the thing down. She says the screen is the perfect size for reading, and the option to use a black background with white text has been really easy on her eyes. Even at full price, I'd have called this a win. On sale, I call this total victory."
"Gift for my wife The price was good for this product, however we have gone through 3 of the previous models with varying issues."
Gifts I just set them up but they seem great and easy to use. I'm planning on given it as a gift to my father and I don't forsee any problems
Goid tablet Bought for web surfing on the couch and watching movies when traveling. Works good and looks good. Appstore not as good as apple or android but that is ok for my use. Price is good on sale.
Good Excellent product would recommend it to all of my friends
Good Good compact size great display stable OS audio is good very limited apps
Good Great price for this item. Gave it as a gift and our daughter said it was easy to set up. And the letters are crisp and clear. Had to order it online but your store got it in a reasonable time period!
Good Is great value for the price. Quality is good. I like that is not heavy.
Good It is good product I will till my friend about it good
good it is worth the money. best bang for buck you cant go wrong with it
"Good It's a good device to surf on the internet but you can't install some Android apps like Chrome, and the camera is horrible. I would recommend it for readers because you can use Hoopla, and that's amazing."
"Good My daughter loved her new tablet.. it was, what we expected."
"Good My daughter loved her new tablet.. it was, what we expected."
"Good Pretty cool tablet for the price, pick it up when its on sale"
"Good all around tablet Was considering a Kindle but decided to get the 8"" fire table to get some Android apps, Internet and a larger screen for reading.The experience had been descent and battery life enough to use all day."
Good amazon fire My son loved his amazon fire HD 8 great for game and books to read
"Good Basic Tablet Bought during Black Friday specials to test out for parents. It's not an iPad, but it works well for the casual tablet user."
"Good basic tablet Easy to use, good quality for a simple tablet, good price"
Good but a bit slow Bought this for my my daughter. Good for slower games. Kind of slow loading pages and when watching videos
"Good but could be better The device is awesome! I bought it for my 6 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. The only problem I have with this fire and the older version that I also own is the poor selection of apps and games that Amazon offers. To get the better apps and games, I have to load Google play store onto it."
Good but has kinks I bought 2 for my kids and got a great discount but the one my daughter uses has gave us a little trouble from the start
Good buy I share the table wit my grandson and we both love all that it can do. I am reading more than ever now and he is playing more games because this tablet has so much more to offer.
good buy My nephew is so happy to have his own tablet. Works pretty good.
Good buy for my needs I can‚Äôt find earphones for my Amazon fire 7th.xxxx
"GOOD CHEAP TABLET After reading several reviews I decided to order the tablet and I would like to say I made a Great Purchase! This is a great tablet for the price. Its a nice quality and you can do anything you can do in an Ipad. The camera quality isnt the best but it is acceptable, especially for the price. I would buy again!"
Good cheap tablet It is what it is good value for cheap tablet. This was a gift purchase
Good choice for low end tab No problem till now.Number one choice for frequent use in the low segment device.
Good deal for price I think the price was great for the Kindle. Perfect gift for Xmas.
"Good enough tablet for an excellent price I purchased on a one day sale for $50, mainly to have an extra tablet laying around for quick access to the web. Found it very useful to work with Amazon shopping and other apps, as well as Alexa/ Screen colorful and sharp, plays movies full screen with only a 2Gbs download wifi connection. Customizing this device has made it much more a true android tablet and so far it's great. Some things still cannot be done vs conventional Android tablets, otherwise would have given 5 stars rather than 4. Highly recommended for the price."
"Good for a 3 year old Great for in the car, restaurant, or doctor appointments!"
"Good for certain situations I bought this tablet originally because of its price. You get what you pay for. Overall, I thought it was a wonderful tablet but it didn‚Äôt fit my needs. I ended up returning it because I didn‚Äôt like the android software. This tablet is wonderful for children and the elderly, but for a previous iPad owner, I decided to buy an iPad and pay more instead."
"Good for entertainment Good device for reading and watching YouTube, Netflix, and shopping. Not so much functional as a tablet."
Good for its price Basic tablet which is pretty good for its price range.
"Good for kids Bought for my 5 year old. He loves it. Not a great camera, but has a lot of fun options. Love Alexa!!"
"Good for Kids Bought it for my nephew, loved it, use it all the time...."
"Good for kids Comparing all other tablets, this one is really good for my kids. User friendly interface and tons of educational apps"
Good for kids Excellent processing speed and best for kids.we can download and stream videos apps and can lock the contents that are not needed
"Good for kids Good for kids, it‚Äôs no iPad but can‚Äôt beat it for the price"
"Good for kids Good for kids, it‚Äôs no iPad but can‚Äôt beat it for the price"
"Good for kids Great tablet, durable and good price. Bought it for our son for Xmas and he loves it!"
Good for kids I bought for my 5 year old. Easy for her to use. Easy for me to track and control screen time.
Good for kids I purchase this for my granddaughter of 9 months. Love the games
Good for price Bought for my 4 year old very easy for him to use and has good parental controls.
"Good for Price I picked up the Fire tablet on a whim when it was on sale at a low price as a backup for traveling and for the kids to use, and make use of streaming services since we have a Prime account. I liked getting a larger screen at a low price. The wifi reception isn't that great, and the touch sensitivity isn't near what I get on the Samsung tablets, but for the price, I'm fine with it, provided that it holds up."
Good for reading book Prices are very reasonable better than other tablet
"Good for sharing books I bought this for reading books and was quite pleased to find out I could access books my husband ordered through Amazon Prime. I do have a couple complaints. One is it seems that every time I charge the Kindle something changes. The first time I charged it, some new icon appeared on the home page. The last time I charged it my book library completely changed. I had the hardest time trying to find the book I had been reading. Instead of listing it at the top of the screen, I found it several sections down. It would be nice if I could click on the book link and have my current book load, but if that's not possible, I wish I didn't have to now go looking for it."
"Good for the buck, but mediocre at best Bought this to replace my aging Nexus 7 (2013) version, but didn't hold a candle up to it. I knew it going in, but wanted to see for myself in person. For $80, can't hardly beat the features, but I was spoiled by arguably the best small Android tablet ever made. I knew the screen resolution was lacking, especially on an 8"" screen, but coming from the Nexus, it was a huge difference. Also, even at 4 plus years old, the processor was humming along smoothly. The extra .5 gb ram was also helpful. Anyways, back to the Fire HD 8. One advantage it had over the Nexus, was the expansion slot. I loved being able to put my media on it, but then again, the media displayed on the screen was subpar, so it's a wash. I installed Google play on it, so that it expanded its functionality, and I'm an avid Amazon conneseiur, but found the table too limiting. Ultimately returned and bought an old, discontinued Fire HD 6 for $20. The resolution almost matches that of the Nexus, so I'm happy for now."
"Good for the money. It's a fast tablet, but doesn't get all the games you can get at the play store. Many apps not available for Kindle."
Good for the price Bought it for my daughter and she loves it. The picture quality is good
"Good for the price I am happy with this product, it works well and it is affordable. The only complaint is the charge input seems a bit weak"
Good for the price This is great for kids and for the price. However they don‚Äôt last that long. If you know that ahead of time you won‚Äôt be disappointed
Good gift This was a xmas gift and is a great gift for someone who uses kindle and Amazon.
Good gift for my 3 yr old Easy to use even for my 3 yr old happy with how it has a lot of apps that are free same as Android to download. Good deal for the price. My son loves it.

Good item using for games and reading outside of the home. works good.
good Kindle The only problem I have with this is slow boot up time
Good little tablet I went in looking for an inexpensive tablet to use while I work out. It is a nice size for watching video or reading. I actually broke the first one while lifting weights so I went back and bought another one.
"Good low cost tablet Good first use tablet, good option tongift to small kids. Works well"
Good low end tablet Camera build to be improved.. play store needs more apps
Good one Good price and good quality. This is one of the best for this price
Good overall reader and tablet This is my second kindle fire. It is much improved over the last one. Very easy to use. Especially like the Alexa feature.
"Good overall table for a kid My sons first table since school is using apps now for supplemental math. He loves it and the child controls are great. Performance is solid, particularly for a grade school kid. The case and price point make this a great buy."

Good quality fun and durable Great quality for kids very fun very durable great warranty gave 4 stars because it could be easier to download shows and such but once I learned (not very tech savvy) it's easy.
Good Quality/Reasonable Price Bought a kindle for my Son almost 4 years ago and it‚Äôs still works like a charm. Bought this one for my Mom for Christmas and she can‚Äôt stay off of it. It‚Äôs safe to say that the Kindle is a great product
good reader Nice product with a nice screen for easy reading. Like the color chooses
Good reader and tablet Easy to set up. Haven't tried all the features yet. Like the reading ability. Easy to hold in your hand. Wanted to find a screen protector though and the market is geared toward Apple users.
"Good resolution With the recent promotion for the Amazon Fire HD8 tablet, I just had to get one. It's been a while since I bought a tablet and the one I currently have is getting to be very slow.The tablet will come with a micro USB charging/data cable and a wall adapter.The tablet itself has some weight to it compared to the kindle tablets but won't be a problem if you use it to read sitting up. Initial setup was very straight forward. Once you connect to the WiFi and login to your Amazon account, you should be in the FireOS interface. The tablet is bundled with Amazon apps so everything is just a few swipes away on the screen. The interface itself, is very smooth so I didn't notice any lags at all. I did try a few games and there were some that were a bit slow at times and this was expected from a tablet at this price range. I will mainly use it to browse online and watch videos so don't see this as a huge setback.The buttons, charging port and headphone jack are all on top which will need some getting used to since most devices I've used had side buttons for the power/volume and charging/headphone ports are at the bottom. To the left side are two speakers and there's a micro SD card slot on the right for those who need more memory. The memory card option will be handy since this tablet is only 16GB and I think you have about 11-12GB free out of the box."
"Good Speaker Very compact speaker, so it's easy to transport. I like that it's also waterproof. I wish it had music controls on the speaker beyond just the volume.....didn't think about it when I bought it though. Still, very high quality."
Good starter tablet Got it for my brother. He uses it to face time great grandkids with my parents. They love seeing their little faces. Easy start up for non techie people.
"Good starter tablet We purchased the Fire for our 9 year old. The price is right for an entry level device and I don't worry too much about it breaking. The charging port has already started to fail, however."
"Good starter tablet Works very well, great value. I would highly recommend."
"good tab I like the size and quick connection, but sometimes App store can't find the items I look for."
Good table for kids The tablet is the same as the adult version and can be used as such until ypu activate a child profile and tou can switch between profiles making it very useful
Good Tablet Bought this for my youngest daughter to have movies to watch on long car rides. Works great. Fast. Nice bright screen. The SD card addition is wonderful so more apps can be added and Netlfix movies can be downloaded.
Good Tablet Bought this tablet for my daughter to read books. But it also was able to play videos that came with her new guitar. GREAT! A good Christmas surprise for the both of us. My daughter LOVES this tablet.
Good Tablet Gave as a Christmas because of the good sale price and could get them quicker than ordering from Amazon

Good Tablet My 3 years old son love this tablet. It's hold charge for hours. Only problem Amazon dose not have YouTube app.
"Good tablet This is a good tablet for the price, nice change from using phone"
Good tablet This was not the best choice for my autistic son. We were unable to download anything from Google Play and were limited to the Amazon store. Making this a deal breaker for us. I had to return it and get a different tablet.
Good Tablet at a Great Price Available decent 8 inch options out there are a bit pricey. 7 inch is little small. Fire HD8 fits the bill and is just right at a great price!
Good tablet for a beginner Works good not as fast but great colors and sounds
Good tablet for a kid I bought it for my son for Christmas. I love it. It's much bigger and sturdier than the other Kindle Fires. The font is bigger and much easier to read. It also holds a charge well.
Good tablet for Amazon Prime users This is a quick and responsive tablet. Apps are limited to The Amazon store for the most part so it's important to make sure the apps you want are both available on Amazon and compatible with this tablet.
Good tablet for good price Bought it for my aunt and she loved it she even told me to buy it for her friend
Good Tablet for Kids My kid loves this Kindle Fire. It keeps my child occupied and learning and is very lightweight and durable.
Good tablet for money Bought this as Christmas gift for son. Good value for money and ease of use.
Good tablet for that price Good value for that money. Maybe only bad thing takes a while for charging.
Good tablet for the little ones Got this tablet for my 1 yo baby. Easy to use and drop resistant. LOVE the cover it came with
"Good tablet for the money Good size to hold while just lounging on the couch or in bed. The tablet does everything I need it to, good for the money!"
"Good tablet for the money So this tablet offers a lot for the price. It's reliable, has a quality screen, good performance (no lag when swiping screen or opening apps), and good battery life. It doesn't feel fragile despite being made of plastic.The only thing I would do different is add GPS capability."
Good tablet for the price If you want a cheap tablet that won‚Äôt break the bank this is the one for you. I use this tablet to play music though my Bluetooth speaker while working out.
"Good tablet, low sound This is a pretty good tablet for kids, but the sound is way to low. Very difficult to hear."
"Good tablet, low sound This is a pretty good tablet for kids, but the sound is way to low. Very difficult to hear."
"Good tablet! Bought couples during holiday season at low price ($50/ea), nice!Pros:- HD display + Fast internet, smooth streamming- Can add more storage by using microSD card- Good size to carry & reading document on the road or worksCons:- No AGPS (but not big deal)- No Google Play Store (but you can side load Google Play. Many instructions available on web)"
Good value Bought on black friday sale. Good tablet for the price
"Good value for the money Although this was a good value for the money, I personally found that the 7"" Fire (which was not HD) had just as good of picture quality and for half the amount, ended up being the better deal, so I returned this one."
"Good value tablet It's very good tablet for < $100, fast and light, good for everyday use and bring along for travel."
"Good, but slow I got this little tablet to carry around with me because it fits in my purse. I like it for what I got it to do - have something to read all the time, but it's REALLY slow. So if you're impatient and don't want to wait for apps to load, don't get this!"

Highly recommend

Great Black Friday deal This is the best priced device that I found with the most functionality. Amazing black Friday deal!!!
"Great but... Great toy for a 6 years old nephew, which was the reason why I buy this tablet. Had all need it for hours of entertainment for my nephew, I download a few games and load a couple of movies, the performance was great but then I found a couple of issues.First, I was unable to directly download any app from the tablet, receive a constant error saying than I need to activate ONE-CLICK DOWNLOAD, I follow all instructions and had to create a virtual credit card (I never insert my real credit card on a 6y/o toy, never), even if my intentions was only download free apps. Nothing works, change the address, change the credit card, try everything and nothing works. Finally I found a bypass method which is use my browser on my pc, connect to the amazon account and link the tablet, then I was able to install new apps.The second issue was to discover than the tablet can be only use on US, my surprise when I try to add more apps when I travel outside US and after hours of trying, found the answer on a forum when indicate than the tablet was created to be use on on US."
Great buy Bought it just because and don‚Äôt regret it one bit. Super fast and crystal clear picture.

"Great device for children I like the closed ecosystem, your kids don't see what they shouldn't, what i didn't like my daughter made a purchase by mistake on day 2, turnoff the the one click buying. also i don't like that its set up like its the parents device with the child using it, so there are two steps to logging in. also i don't like the lack of google apps, the device itself itself has a great screen and weight, the bumper is tough and easy to clean, and overall i would recommend it for a 4yo."
Great device for young children ! Easy access to a lot of different apps . My daughter loves to watch YouTube and Netflix .

"Great Device, Inexpensive but not Cheap I'd been contemplating trying out an Amazon Fire for a while just to see if I'd recommend it to a friend as a reliable communications device. I was going to just spend $49 for the least expensive Amazon Fire but when I found this Fire HD on sale for $79 I grabbed it up. What a smart choice. Not only is it great for email (I'm using the Outlook client app) but texting too (I'm using the Verizon text app) it's great for watching movies and listening to music as well."
Great e-reader The Amazon Kindle Fire is an excellent. I got 3 of these on black friday. However I was unaware that the tablet were the offers version.

"Great for kids We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface."

Great for kids We like the durability but wish there were more applications available (Google play store). The other challenging thing is we would prefer to have more control over what the kids can do. Our standards are a bit different than whoever is in charge of choosing age appropriate apps.

"Great for kids and Grandparents! Easy to use. Easy to read. The SILK browser a little slow. Adequate for regular apps.Honestly, I have not maximized its potential."
"Great for kids or adults This is a great, easy to use tablet. It's nice because it doesn't have to be ""just a kids tablet."" I can do what I want to do on there as well. The parental controls are great. The case makes it feel pretty durable. The battery lasts a really long time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we can't get all of our apps/games on there because they're not available which is pretty disappointing. One real popular one we can't get is YouTube kids. My son loved that. He was pretty bummed about that. Overall we love the tablet, and would definitely recommend it."

"Great for long trips Bought this Kids Kindle at the Westland in a sealed box. Purchased this because of the 2 year warranty against anything and the 1 year access to Kindle software. It was purchased for a 2 year old. My daughter and her Marine husband were going to an Army base in Missouri the next day about a 12 hour drive. This Kindle has a SD slot so I wanted to load up a bunch of kids movies to keep him entertained on the trip, and then be able to get kids educational software later. The trip went fine and the Kindle worked great. Attached it to the headrest of the front seat with rubber bands. Unfortunately when they arrived in Mossouri and my daughter tried to register the Kindle, Amazon said it wasn't a Kids Kindle. I contacted the local Best Buy and explained the problem and they said it could be exchanged no problems. So the next week my daughter and her husband made the 75 mile drive from the Army base to Jefferson City the nearest Best Buy and made the exchange no hassles. While still in the store my daughter contacted Amazon and successfully registered the Kids Kindle. They've made several long road trips since and the access to kids movies on the SD chip have been a blessing. It's held up well to a 2 year olds handling and overall works very well. Great service from Best Buy."
"Great for Mobile Games - Not Great for Online For the price this is a great purchase, but don't expect it to perform like an iPhone or high end mobile device. If you're buying this to play mobile apps it's great with minimal lag."
Great for my 4yo My daughter loves this tablet! It's got loads of apps to choose from & the graphics are great!
Great for my books and easy to carry around. It's highly functional and compact. Easy to navigate and I just love it.
Great for my child Loved it! Great product for my 10 year old son!!!!
"Great for my game Really enjoying my new Kindle HD Fire 8"" screen! It's a step up from my old Kindle 7"" that I used for over 5 years and this one is a little larger and also very quick for the game I like to play on it. It's also useful to browse on facebook and check my email. All my books I had on my old Kindle are right here on my new one so was able to just get hooked up to my internet and get right back to what I was doing before! Very satisfied with my new Kindle!"
Great for my grandchild I grandson loves this cannot put it down.it is very easy to use
Great for my grandson My grand son loved this tablet. Love the Amazon warranty.
Great for my great grandson My great grandson loves it he watches movies on it
Great for my kids My kids love it. Simple learn and had many accessories that can purchased to protect it.
Great for my price Purchased for young girl and she love it. Perfect for games
Great for my Young Son My 5 year old son has had many electronic hand me downs and we got him this one for Christmas and we could not be happier. Easy to use and plenty fast to keep up with all the games and videos he enjoys so much. I am thinking about getting a second one for my wife and I to use.Great product for the money.
Great for nighttime shopping This tablet has great graphics and clarity. The screen is is just right for a nighttime reader.
"Great for our 18 Month Old Daughter Enjoyed the color, construction, and ability to control viewing for our daughter."
"Great for parents wanting to monitor tablet usage As a grandparent, we purchased two of these for our grandsons (of course with Mom's help). We were looking at a normal tablet (Samsung/Apple) and finally decided on the Fire HD 8. The boys just love them, mom is happy that she can put time limits on usage and from looking at the loaded applications, they are very appropriate for child learning (strategy, logic development, etc.). We would buy them again if needed."

Great for preschoolers Easy to setup. Large screen. Protective case built-in. Two year protection plan included.
Great for someone who likes to read This was easy to set up. If you are used to apple products this is a difficult transition.
"Great for the cost It doesn't compete with the iPad in terms of screen resolution or performance but for the price it does remarkably well. Battery life is outstanding compared to the 7"" fire. Very pleased with the purchase."
"great for the kids My kids haven't been able to put this down since they got it. They love all of the game options on it, many which are free. I bought two of them a month ago and have had no problems. I haven't even ran out of memory yet."
Great for the Money Can not complain. Especially for the price. You can't beat it.
Great for the non-technical Amazon Fire tablets are great for the non-technical user. 90% of people can use them however they are locked down to the Amazon ecosystem which prevents you from easily using applications in the Android Google Play store.
Great for the price Bought a couple for my kids for xmass and they love them.
"Great for the price great price, but doesn't do a number of things that it should. and the advertisements every time I turn it on really suck"
"Great for the price If I wasn't able to install Google Play Store I would not have picked up, but it's not too difficult to do so. I don't care about the potato spec camera because I have a decent camera on my phone. I would still prefer a higher DPI to make text clearer but even that aspect is not that bad. Usually speaker quality on such cheap products are bad but on this they are surprisingly nice. If on a hard surface the Dolby Atmos seems to do something with the sound, not sure how to describe it but if feels like a much wider soundstage. There's a YouTube video called ""$80 Tablet vs $800 Tablet Review"" that was the final straw in terms of convincing me. He dropped the tablet from a high distances onto a hard lamented floor, sometimes almost slamming it. The tablet was fine while the floor showed some damage. Perhaps there are some super demanding games that don't run well (I don't know I haven't checked), but for everything else it's does the job well enough."
Great for the price It‚Äôs a great tablet. The only downside is that some apps you can‚Äôt get. I do a lot of crafting and I‚Äôm unable to download the cricut Design app.
great for the price my stepdaughter is still learning how to navigate it but she mostly spends her time on youtube on it awesome product

"Great improvement I had one of the original Kindle Fire tablets and it was good, but this one is so much more. Good work!"
"Great inexpensive tablet and ereader The Kindle 8"" is a decent tablet computer not only for reading books, but also just a nice inexpensive device to have for when you need access to the internet or want to play a couple games.While it isn't the most powerful tablet out there, you also won't feel that put out if it gets broken or swiped.I would also highly recommend the Amazon-branded case for it. Not only does it fit seamlessly, the magnets built into the case put the device to sleep when you close the cover."

If you already have a kindle, such as the paperwhite, you might not like this for reading, but add all that the kindle fire brings, and you easily can leave the kindle at home on trips and such."
Great memory My baby likes it and it's help her with her school work.

Listen to music. Read emails. So many applications in an inexpensive, portable tablet. If you subscribe to Amazon prime, this is a must have."
Great new features Perfect size. Love new features. Easy to use......
"Great Packaging Good Functioning First off, I‚Äôm primaril an Apple product user that chose this unit because of its price & child centered form factor. Price - compared to an iPad was - & form factor such as weight & resilience from being dropped from reasonable heights were definite strengths. The ability to discretely control access for a 2 to 4 users was also a plus. Relative down side for me has been counter intuitive user interface as compared to Apple products."

My 8 yr old wants one now and she currently has a ipad but says the amazon works better and she loves the selection of books. I would recommend this tablet"

"Great tablet for a fraction of an iPad This is a wonderful tablet with a great screen, reliable touch responsiveness and a clean UI.The only drawback is the lack of the Google Play Store and Play Services."
Great tablet for a gift I bought this for my niece as a gift and she loved it! Can't go wrong with a tablet.
"Great Tablet for a Great Price Awesome little tablet for very cheap. The ads on the lock screen are kind of cheesy, but screen resolution is solid and it runs all the regular apps. My IPad is nicer and runs smoother, however costs hundreds more. For the price, this product can't be beat."
great tablet for a great price This has worked perfect for me and my little ones to play some games and email. Still exploring all abilities.
"Great tablet for a senior. My new tablet, is easy to use, it is also very easy to travel with."
"Great tablet for a simple user I love how thin it is. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 and honestly I like this one better. Its simple, has a beautiful user interface, and it multitasks well. The battery life is great. Very loud speakers to be a tablet. Its much different from an iPad or Android tablet, it took a little bit of exploring to fully figure everything out, and the settings are more limited but it works for what I need. The only con I've found so far is that the Appstore is more limited than Apple or Google Play but I haven't had a problem finding similar apps."

"Great tablet for my 6 yr old My granddaughter was thrilled to see her new tablet on the day of her birthday. The color and size was perfect for her little hands. She could not wait for the tablet to charge. She kept asking if the tablet was ready to turn on. When the tablet finally charged, she could not put it down. She went from room to room showing her brothers what she could do with her tablet. Everybody wanted to do something with her tablet. As a parent, I just love the rubber bumper. The rubber bumper around the tablet is an excellent bonus to the tablet. It helps protect the tablet if it drops or falls accidentally. We all know how little hands sometimes drops things more than once. I only wish we could have bought this tablet much sooner. Being a first grader this year, my granddaughter can really benefit while using this tablet. Also, there are many educational opportunities for young children to engage themselves in instead of being glued to the television on a daily basis. This tablet is more child-centered and parental controlled."

Great tablet for speedy use to gather information. Tablet is easy to set up and to use. The Alexa function is a great asset. It is small enough to carry anywhere and functions with the precision one would get from a fuller size tablet. Great functional tech tool.
Great tablet for the basics I got this tablet because my wife bought the same thing when she upgraded her Kindle. I was shopping all kinds of tablets. But I didn't want to spend big money just to surf my emails and watch video. This does both very well. Super fast with my wi-fi! Great tablet for the money!

"Great tablet for the price If you are looking for this $80 tablet to compare with a $350 IPad, you will be disappointed. But for what you pay...it's an outstanding little tablet. The screen has a nice crisp picture and the sound is very good. If you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, then this purchase is a no-brained. Even if you aren't, it's a great Netflix player, web browser, and kindle reader. Great value for $80."
"Great Tablet for the Price Lovely tablet, works well for my use. Would definitely buy again"

Great tablet for young kids This replaced an older kindle and it is a great product.
Great tablet for younger kids This is a great tablet for my 3 and 5 year old and I don't stress when they get dropped because of the protective case!
"Great tablet geared toward lids My daughter is artistic, and we were looking for a tablet that would not only serve as a teaching tool, but also be able to put up with typical abuse of a toddler. It is only lacking the ability to download apps from the google play store, which can be worked around by downloading the apk files and installing them. The other issue is being able to move said apps from the play store to the child‚Äôs profile of the tablet. I am still working on finding a way to make this happen."

"Great Tablet option for the kiddo! Purchased this tablet for my kiddo, very easy to set up and he loves it!"
"Great tablet overall I absolutely love my kindle. This is the second one that I've had, and the only reason I bought another was because my ex broke the first one. Its a great tablet to read on, but i also use it to watch Netflix, go on social media, and play games. It's the size of a book so it's never uncomfortable to hold and the battery life lasts forever."
Great tablet so far I bought this tablet to replace another one I had that ran to slow and had barely any storage space and so far so good! I've been using it for a few hours everyday for about a week and haven't had to recharge yet! The tablet runs quickly opening browsers and apps. It has more storage than my other tablet and has an SD card port. Even though it's an 8in screen it does it feel like it because the pictures are so vivid. So far the only thing I don't like is that you can't mirror or cast it to a TV or computer screen. Other than that it seems to work great.
Great tablet with a lot of uses Purchased this for my wife because of the size. She loves it!
"Great Tablet, bad sound The tablet has great picture and apps but the sound is really bad and this is 3rd tablet"
"Great tablet, Great! Awesome product, great battery life! I will say this is the best tablet for this awesome price!"

"Great tablet/book My old kindle fire needed replacingLove my new one, great features, lightening fast, New size is easy on the eyes"
Great tablets for kids Great size easy to hold overall it a great tablet.
Great technology toy This toy is a look into the future on fuel energy.
"Great to get amazon freeplay. When you get this device please update the software (you might have to run update a few times - I did it 4 times) and then it will start to work properly. Also, if you are not an Amazon table user, then some of this is slightly different to use. Great for the kid to use and the apps in freeplay seem to be great for my kid of 7"
Great to help with young readers My Goddaughter love playing games on my tablet and watching her shows. Not we can load her favorite books and shows on her on tablet.
Great to use in home Great product I got it to stream you tube from device to my tv
"Great upgrade Wonderful newest generation. Faster and lighter than the last one. Also nice upgrade to the home screen programming. Make's it much easier to see and find what you have looked at. It is used for everything from reading, internet, shopping, email and even spreadsheets. Also, the price is a no brainer. Great little tablet."
"Great Upgraded tablet I upgraded from Fire HD 8.9 this tablet is fast, and I love how it has for memory card my other one lacked that. My tablet came charged at 75% I have the fast charger since that is what I use with my other tablet. I have to say it took 1hr to fully charge. I am not sure why that other reviewer complained that it took a day to charge and that is wrong. Maybe he should invest in the fast charger?The sound is pretty good without headphones. I love that is not too big or small good enough to take anywhere. For the price and for what you are getting this a great tablet for anyone."
"Great Value For the price Amazon is offering these tablets they're great! Honestly, if you're looking for something to watch Netflix, YouTube, basic apps as well as play a few games these tablets are amazing. I love the fact that their great quality for the price. Obviously they're not the best tablets in the entire world, but for what you pay, their fantastic."
Great value Good tablet with easy functionality. Size makes it easily portable.
Great value Great product for the price. It is not a high end tablet but great for browsing and reading
Great value Received order quickly and compete. I recommend purchasing grin best buy.
"Great value This tablet is a rock star. I do everything on it. Bright display, sound, And an unbeatable price. Of course, the price point is due to the baked in advertisements that you get every time the device wakes up - a little annoying, but manageable. Again, that price really makes it for me and it really is quite capable."
"Great value for money, but lacks apps I mean, you can't argue with the price of this, but it's lacking some big name apps that I thought would have Amazon Fire versions but don't. Like Dropbox or BBC News or LA Times. Screen is great. Battery seems to last a long time. And the size is better than iPad if you're using it for reading mostly, you can hold it in one hand. I'd recommend... but with caution that you're going to be missing some useful apps."
"Great value for money. I purchased this tablet during the black Friday deals and for the price it is a pretty decent tablet. There is no lag when browsing multiple pages and even watching videos. 4 stars given as I haven't fully explored all features, but so far so good!"
"Great Value! My primary tablet is the iPad Pro but I couldn't resist picking up the Amazon Fire tablet at Best Buy during their Amazon promotion day when the price dropped by $30. I really like the smaller size compared to my iPad Pro. By default, the display brightness was set to adjust automatically but I found this to make the screen too dark, especially for watching videos on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Fortunately, that is easily adjustable in the display settings. I know this drains the battery quicker but the battery still lasts several days with limited use. I paired a bluetooth keyboard to it just to try and it worked fine. The ads that appear when unlocking the screen really don't seem to be a bother. Given the price of this tablet I really have no complaints."
Great Value. User friendly. Lightweight. Easy for the kids to use. Fast start up. 4 year old operates it easily. Didn't get 5 stars because it was broken in less than a month. Buy the warranty if it's for a child.
"Great value. Camera could use an upgrade. I am happy with the Fire given the price I paid. As reviews stated, the camera is not very good. Would like it better if it could mirror to a smart TV. Otherwise, for the value it is a good product."
"Great Video....however I bought it to run a lot of home automation things. But after 5 apps wouldnt run like I expected them to, it was of little use to me."
Great way for kids to learn Teaches with a well known strategy and keeps them entertained.
"Great, just what I needed! Great value, perfect for what my needs are. Would highly recommend this product. This is the second one I've bought."
Great! I bought this Kindle just to have a dedicated e reading device. The price was extremely reasonable.
"Great! I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he will not put it down. He has checked on all of his accounts, downloaded his VUDU movies and other movies from other apps that he previously purchased, played games, and everything else you can do with a tablet. He also uses it for reading, too."
Great! This product was a great purchase. i highly recommend it!
GREAT. Easy to use I got it for my kids age 4 and 8 it came with 1 year of free subscription. When I set kids profiles each got apps best selected for their age. So my 8y.o. won't play 'baby games'. Sometimes they like to change to watch cartoons that not available on their tablet. Time limit is very helpful. I set the tablet to lock after 1.5 hour of use and at 9 pm whatever comes first. I wish there were more apps in different languages to download.
Greatest Love these tablets so much. This is the third one I purchased for someone else in the family
Gret gift for KIDS IT is a great gift for kids for $90+. Kids love it and we have parental controls to set the playtime or screen time so that we can limit the usage with our parental controls.
Gxbbcfh Huh what do I get to say I got it to you have you done that I ghj
Had to return in a week This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying.

Happy Birthday to me This was a birthday gift! It has nice visual features! It was easy to get started on it! So far so good!!
"Happy Happy Happy I got this so I could watch Game of Thrones in bed. Does everything I want it to. Speaker is great, clarity and sound perfect. Takes great pictures. Plus, I can play any of my favorite books. Very happy with my purchase"
"Happy son! We bought this as a gift for our son's birthday - he couldn't be happier with color, and we couldn't be happier with the price. We now own 3 Kindles, and have been happy with every one!"
"Happy with Amazon Fire HD 8 I bought this Amazon Fire HD 8 purely for personal travel use because I dont like to bring my laptop in case if I lose my laptop! This Amazon Fire is cheap enough that if I lose it during personal travel, I don't care & I will just buy another one. This is my first Amazon Fire. So far, I am happy because the screen is big enough during internet surfing that I can see a whole lot better than my 4"" cell phone. If I could ""re-do"" my purchase, I should have purchased the Amazon Fire 7. Both Fire 7 & HD 8 fit in my side pants' pocket, but HD 8 is a bit bigger & thus heavier. When I looked at both Fire 7 & HD 8 in the Best Buy store, they were not connected to wi-fi. So I purchased HD 8. And, I will keep HD 8. I dont think it would be right for me to return it to BB to exchange for 7 because I already opened the package. Overall, I am happy with Fire HD 8."
Hate to POP up Add's Why do I get so many POP Up Adds on this! Its a great product but it's always trying to sell me something!
"Have a few days to charge it? I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before."
HD fire 8 Love the beautiful color of this tablet. Features are also great for a tablet like this.
HD tablet Good tablet for browsing or playing easy games. Hope movies work well but haven't tried.
"Ho-Hum, Good & Bad I can only compare my Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) to my two Fire HD 7 8 GB 2012 (2nd Gen) units.Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) - Pros- Wider screen - better for viewing movies.- Multiple small icons on home screen.- Around 50% more RAM- Can add microSD up to 256 GB (no need to buy 32 GB)- Good value w/ $20 discount: $59 is lot less than the Fire HD 2012.- Offers Alexa, but I haven't figured it out (I have a Fire Stick on HDTV).Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) - Cons- Same 1208 x 800, 720p HD resolution.- Only 1.3 GHz (2012 was 1.2 GHz)- Crummy front/rear cameras, no auto-focus; 2012 rear only, w/ auto-focus.- Retains panels of previously used screens: annoying to delete.- Can only send Prime videos to HDTV via Fire Stick.- No micro-HDMI port to send any content to HDTV- Held horizontal, all controls and wires are awkwardly located on one side.- Blue Shade (read at night) seems useless.- Amazon brand case is too expensive and does not stand well in portrait view.- Reviews for third party cases: sometimes expensive, almost always shoddy, usually fail at portrait viewWhere is the Amazon brand case with a fitted snap-on hard back and a fold over cover that offers true protection? I have them for my Paperwhite 2nd Gen and Fire HD 2012 - they are excellent. On/off and volume control buttons failed on one Fire HD 2012. The other 2012 works perfectly after six years. Paperwhite is fantastic.Note: Fire HD 10 32 GB with 1920 x 1200 and 1080 resolution offers much better viewing, but $150 is way too much. A current $80 discount for iPad 2017 makes Apple's entry model $249. I may try it.Bottom line: If it comes back to $59, the Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) is a worthwhile purchase."
"HOOKED on my Fire 8HD I've owned a couple iPads, three Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and I can without question say that this Fire 8HD is my favorite out of all. The 16Gig version is all you need. Why? Becuase the micro-sd card expands to 256 gig and the programs can be installed to the external drive...saving the valuable internal for the operating system. Samsung should do the same...if they did, I'd probably wouldn't have bought the Fire, but I'm so glad I did!! Love, love, love it!!"
Horrible The ads that pop up constantly make us almost unusable for kids.
"Huge bang for your buck Small, powerful, and does well. I love this thing. It has all the apps I‚Äôd want a tablet to have and performs very well. My only complaint would be battery life being a bit on the poor side - but that‚Äôs my complaint with most of my electronics."
"Huge upgrade from the 7"" The extra ram makes all the difference regarding speed and responsiveness"
"I bought 2 and so should you. I bought 2 and we have enjoyed our tablets extremely. We use them all the time to watch shows on our Prime Account or Documentaries that are free, there are also free shows to watch as well and you can read books."
I bought for my grandson to play on I bought for my 11 year old grandson to play games on.
I highly recommend this product It's the best think I ever bought for my so & grandkids
I love my Kindle Fire 8 There are so many different options other than just reading that I can use.
I love the incredible price point! The 8 inch size is great! I live that it has a very reasonable price.
"I love these tablets This is my third Kindle Fire tablet. The features, the apps, the ease of use, the display, and the fact that these tablets can do more than you might think is what keeps me coming back."
I use it for games while traveling I use it for games only for when I am traveling. It is a little slow but does what I bought it for
Ideal Great for my kids. They love it. And download games and music all the time
"If you own an Alexa Device, A Must Have! If you own an Alexa Device, This is a must have. It makes using an Amazon Device so easy. The OS is Android. It is not the most user friendly device for getting out apps but you will figure it out sooner or later. I deducted a star for that. For the price, It is a good device. Thanks!"
Indestructable! The kids love them! They give their mom a break when she needs one!
"Inidtructsble but great warranty anyway My 2 year old broke her email pro easily Being a toddler I wasn't surprised but email makes you buy a brand new one so I bought this instead. Nowe originally she had the 7 generation one and it was only 16 G and it ran out of battery in like 4.5 hours. The 8 generation 32 G allows ny 2 year old to download plenty but with parental controls I customized myself and for a long day at the RMV or doctor office or a drive 3vstates away, even if she takes a break I don't have to recharge it for more like 9 hours. This is with downloading and watching movies and full episodes if all her favorite b shows. Also she's crazy abusive with it and it functions perfectly. My 4 year old ha's it too and his preschool teachers are begging me to tell them how he's so quick to learn almost everything they put in front of him and his vocabulary has significantly improved as well. I'm so happy with it I'm going to buy one for myself as well as a back up incase one is stolen. Only issue is the kids get addicted so it's real important to b set the timer to shut the system down so they remember to take potty breaks and play outside, but other than that I am thrilled with this product"
"Is it necessary to use credit card I thought this would be a great gift for a child until I got to the set up. The set up could not be completed unless a credit card number was entered. I refuse to put that type of information in the hands of a child so, I returned it."
It is a Christmas gift for my grandchildren I bought 2 for my grandchildren so they can do their schoolwork on it..after xmas I will make an appointment with geek squad to have you show them how to use it...as I don't know how to...
"It is ok for my grand daughter This is actually the 3rd one that I have bought. My Grandkids love them, and I love the warrantee that you can purchase with them."
It is working good This is cheap and best and working very good for the price
"It took 6 years but they finally got it right It's still a Kindle. It's main purpose is to be a device that pushes Amazon content on you. It's not a replacement for an iPad or any other ""real"" tablet. That said, Amazon has finally created a well designed, lightweight device that is snappy and feels great in your hands. The cover is also well done. This is the Kindle that should've been 6 years ago. Oh well."
It was very easy to use My grandson loved this product.it was very easy to use.
"It worked 30 minutes, shut off and won‚Äôt start It‚Äôs great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card, but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly"
It's a Christmas gift for my daughter I bought the cover for the tablet as well and I'm very happy with the product.
"It's a gift ! When my lady friend looked at this model in the store and almost panted for one, I made up my mind to get her one for Christmas."
It's a good phone at a good price Mario gave me and excellent customer service. Nice guy.
"It's exactly what I was expecting,good. It has a good display and the sound is pretty impressive, I'm glad I got one,couldn't pass up the price"
It's good Bought for our son. It's not built as well as the Ipad but it has the things he is interested in.
"It's good for shopping... on Amazon Get this for shopping and fun, not for productivity. This is an inexpensive tablet chocked full of bloatware and ads. I got it for the wife and she uses it to play mini games and shop, and that's what it's meant for so mission accomplished.The GOOD: It's cheap. Fairly good battery life. Fairly decent screen. Quick charge time.The BAD: It always has some sort of advertising for amazon shopping - annoying at times. Sound quality is terrible. Made of super slippy material, hard to hold; get a case for this or you will drop it; often. Amazon only apps. No android or IOS apps will work with this. It's kinda slow. No YouTube.Overall: If you need a simple tablet for light web browsing, shopping, music, movies, reading and small games then this will work fine. As a primary productivity tablet, forget it. Get something way more robust than this."
It's great my 6 year old has not put this down!! It is easy to use and she loves the games that are already preinstalled!

"It's love!!!!! Our favorite item for the kids screen time! We have a few others, same brand and different, and this one is our favorite one!"
It's no IPAD Have owned IOS products as long as I can remember. Not on same level
It's what I wanted This edition of the kindle fire is a great improvement over the last model I had. The battery life is much better and it charges faster. The only drawback I have experienced is that the operation is sometimes slow. But I attribute that to having a 200GB expansion chip.
It‚Äôs good product for kids It‚Äôs best product for kids reading and watching videos on amazon
Its great I wanted something for reading and surfing the web and i love it.
Its great I wanted something for reading and surfing the web and i love it.

"Just as advertised. This was a replacement Kindle for my husband, who used his first one to death. He loves it."
"Just as good as last one Nice crisp display, good weight and size, battery lasts a fair amount of time"
"Just OK Disappointed with screen brightness. I would not recommend it. And, yes, I adjusted the screen to maximum."
Just the right size The tablet is the perfect size to fit into my purse for taking everywhere.
Just what I needed Good deal on this. Needed a cheap yet reliable tablet and it was a great choice
Just what I needed It‚Äôs the perfect size and weight. I have had iPads in the past but decided to try this and will not go back to iPads. It does all I need.
Just what I needed! I was looking for a Bluetooth tablet for the car. My kids play DJ with the Kindle 8 HD. I purchased 64 GB of additional storage and filled it with music! Love this and it works great!
Just what we needed! Great purchase highly recommended. Would definitely buy again.
Just what we needed! Great purchase highly recommended. Would definitely buy again.
Keeps kids busy Updating 3 tablets for my kids from fire 7. Kids love them. Can keep them from fighting in a few seconds
Keeps kids entertained Great tablet it has lots of games and books and educational stuff for kids. Parents can also use as regular tablet which is a plus.
"Keeps the kids busy! What more can I say besides the fact that this tablet is excellent for children? With it's child proof casing, child features, and 2 year warranty INCLUDED, it's a STEAL for any parent not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on an iPad that may break shortly into its usage!"
Keeps turning off on its own I bought this tablet to use with my 3 year old autistic son. I tried 3 different tablets and all 3 were defective. It would turn off by itself during a video. We were using It for his therapy sessions and this was very inconvient. Switched to a 7 and have had no trouble since.

Kid Friendly Very easy to use and understand for my 4 year old.
"Kid/Adult friendly Good product for what we needed it for. It keeps my little man busy when we're in the vehicle. Bad thing is, you'll have to pre-download items for them to play on the go, or just add your own movies for the long rides."
Kidproof This tablet is perfect for my grandkids. It is just the right size and comes with the protective case which is a MUST!
Kids Fire Tablet I love it! Recently drove to Texas and this device was a life saver. It kept my daughters entertained the times they were awake. Definitely recommend and its great for Adults too!

"Kids love it, many parental controls. Great price I bought two for my grand kids. Their parents love them ands so do the kids. Durable and great for steaming video."
Kids Love it. Easy to use no Complains at all. Bought the case also and now the kids use it all the time.
"Kids need credit card? Bought this for my young son, because of the warranty. You are required to have a credit card stored in the account, and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like Alexa. This is the most ridiculous setup ever."
Kids Tablet Nice product! Would Recommend! Kids love it a lot!!
"Kids tablet Perfect for our grandson, mom loves the parental controls and I love the no questions asked replacement policy!"
"Kindle I absolutely love the kindle fire, its is more affordable than spending hundreds of dollars on an apple product"
Kindle 8hdx Replaced my mother kindle that was on the fritz. She was extremely happy to receive it.
"Kindle Fire Good tablet for Amazon lovers, not so good for Android lovers.Too much Amazon advertising ad nauseum.. Can't get Google Play apps. Miss google. Returned to store.thanks"
Kindle Fire My wife loves her kindle fire. It has gotten major use since purchase.
Kindle Fire 8 I love the Kindle Fire! So far it has great speed and is very user friendly.
Kindle fire 8 HD Good for beginners. Although you need to have a google account and a credit card to start up. For reading purposes only.
"Kindle Fire 8 is great product at a great price Compared to other tablets, the Amazon Kindle Fire is much more affordable, and just as useful as other tablets. THis is a great item and we love it"
"Kindle Fire HD 8 7th Gen. I love my new Fire HD 8, it's great. I have a 7 inch that I got last year, I just wanted a bigger screen and the new one also has more storage!"
Kindle Fire tablet Great price for a great product. I‚Äôve never heard any complaints about the kindle brand nor do I have any. Very happy with my purchase.
"Kindle Kids Purchased this for my 18 month old granddaughter, had to return the first one due to it crashing. The second one has done the same , but plan on giving it a few more days before returning it. A little disappointed with it, expected it to be better than what it is."
"Kindle Rocks I love the Amazon Kindle Fire. I've had one for a couple years, so we bought one for our granddaughter. Can't wait to see her dive in."
Kindles best I recently purchased the Kindle Fire 8 to replace a lost Kindle HD. The Fire 8 is an excellent upgrade and much better than the HD. The Fire 8 was recommended by one of the Best Buy staff that was very knowledgeable on the product. I highly recommend the Fire 8 and Best Buy
Kire We bought a pink kindle kore for my daughter and we love it. Its the beat one we have found
Kire We bought a pink kindle kore for my daughter and we love it. Its the beat one we have found
"lighter, faster more features than my old Kindle What a pleasure. This unit is lighter, faster and has more capability than my old Kindle Fire. I can use it with Spotify to play music, watch Amazon or Netflix movies, use numerous apps and read the numerous books in my library. I especially like it for web surfing. Though I still read lots of books on it."
"Lightweight tablet for reading I had been using a 7 inch fire and purchased the 8 inch to replace it. It is the right weight and size for my reading style. Has all the bells and whistles on my iPad, but easier for reading in my opinion."
Like my kindle This is a replacement kindle my old one was a second generation this is a 7th generation really like it
"Like the size and memory Bought as a gift, has larger screen size and memory for the same price."
"Like the size of the 8 inch model Very comfortable and easy to use. Has plenty of storage for my usage. I mainly use it for books, internet and old school games( solitair, sodium and crossword puzzles."
"Like the size, features and price Had to order on line, since I wanted a yellow Fire. Works well and way expected. Only comment is the battery seems to go faster than expected."
Looks good Well it is not for me but it looks very nice for young kids...
Love I couldn't wait to get another kindle. I had one and lost it.
Love I got this Kindle for my 5 year old to play games. She really like it.
"LOVE I purchased this for my daughter, so that she can read on the go. She loves it."
"Love We have had this device for.over a week now and we love it! We have been able to use apps that encourage my daughter with special needs development, watch movies on it and read books we don't already own through it! Both of my daughters love it... Maybe too much. I will say the interface is a little confusing to switch between the parent and the child profiles. This is not very intuitive as you have to go into the free time app to do so, but otherwise it's fairly easy to use once you understand it."
love amazon tablet bought this on Amazon special deal day. love size of it and storage capacity and quickness of download and all apps can get
Love em I bought these for my kids they really love them I love the fact that I can change parental settings in their learning time and the kids really enjoy them

Love it Wanted to have multiple books available for when I travel and this works great.
"Love it - Does it all Let me say that this is my first Fire tablet. I've previously had either iPad's or Android tablets. I was skeptical at first because I've generally only liked iPad's, but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did."
Love it! Great - easy to use. Nice and clear screen. Would recommend

Love my tablet Love my tablet love how I able to get to my Amazon account. How easy it is to handle
"Love my tablet. I am so glad I bought this for myself for Christmas. I am disabled and this is so nice and portable for me. I ended up in the hospital in March and I took it with me. Also when our tv went out, we were told it would be 4 days till a serviceman could come out. I got hulu and was watching my programs on the tablet. I am 63 yrs old and I could with the help of my granddaughter use it. It was a piece of cake."
"Love that they come in colors Great product for my kids, hours of entertainment!"
Love the 8 Third kindle. First was just a reader. Second was fire 7 HDX. Great screen and graphics. Love the rear facing camera. I still use all 3.

Love the Kindle My whole family has a Kindle and loves them. Upgraded my wife to the 8 inch because she is constantly on it.
Love the Kindle Fire Kindle Fire is a great product. This is my Wife‚Äôs 3rd one
"Love the longer battery life This is my third kindle. The longer battery life is a big plus for someone who loves to exercise the brain working Sudoku puzzles and playing Candy Crush. The ""8"" is a little more awkward to hold in my hand than the "" 7"" but not a major problem."
"Love the new kindle fire it was very easy to get started & move forward, downloading apps is easy"
"Love the upgrade! I bought my first Kindle five years ago, and decided to get a new one recently. I love the upgrade!"

Love this kindle! This was a gift and so far myMom loves it. She plays on it all the time.

Love this! This tablet is great. My 2 yr old loves the puzzles and games. He plays them with or without sound which was nice during church last week. I dont let him play for too long but it sure does come in handy when I need him to be entertained. Its Also durable so I dont worry about it breaking. My son has dropped it a few times and stood on it and its fine!
Love this. Love this tablet alot. It's a good price. Easy to use and navigate.
"Love, Love it! Great little tablet, I upgraded my grandsons other tablet to this one, it was a good decision. Again the camera is not very good, but other than that it's actually really very nice! I would recommend this to a friend or relative."
lovely amazing tablet for kids and also adults can switch out between kid accounts and also adult account
Loves how easy and fast it is. The tablet was really easy to set up and is fast and does not stall as other tablets I have used. I have had one before and they are long lasting and very durable.
Lovin' my kindle This is my first ever kindle and I'm just lovin' everything about it! The fact that I can do a lot of things with it is just great!
Low price but still usable The is an entry level tablet for those who are looking for a budget tablet. I believe you can only access to Amazon App Store - which has fewer apps as compared to Apple Store and Google Play.
Low this item. I reccomend this tabley yo every one. I purchased it for my brorher and he live it.
Makes learning fun. Purchased for a 3 and 4 yr old grandchild for preschool. Software included will take them many years ahead. Both children just took off with scheduled programs. Very solid instrument easy parental control setup. Best life investment ever. Very happy and so are the kids.
"Many functions for such a price I bought this for myself just to check my emails and messages on a larger screen than my phone. Now I find I can do so much more with it. Listen to music, pay my bills. Just as good as an iPad at a fraction of the cost."
"Mini Computer I love my Fire HD. It was a gift from my son for Christmas and I am able to load all sorts of apps, books and music on it. Having fun using it instead of my laptop."
Mom loves her Kindle! This is an upgrade for my mom and she loves hers. She uses it everyday and it has been great. Looking forward to the bigger screen for her.
Mommy loves it I got this for my mom for christmas. It is a cheap alternative to using a small phone screen
More than a reader. I had an old Kindle and loved it. When it quit I bought this one. It 's more like a tablet than a reader and the battery life is not great.
"Mother-in-law loves it! Got it for my mother-in-law. After we set it up, it wad easy for her to work. Would definitely recommend."
Much better than a cheaper alternative. I bought a cheaper alternative and had to return it three days later. This product is 100 %better.
"MUCH IMPROVED OVER OLD FIRE 7 WIFE LOVES IT ,WAS EASEY TO CONVERT FILES FROM OLD KINDLE FIRE"
Much improved previous models Many great improvents over my previous kindle from 4 years ago. It's easy to use and really affordable.
"Multipurpose on the go For reading books, downloading apps and having something convenient to travel with, very good bang for your buck!"
Must buy Brought this for my granddaughter who is a bit rough with her toys. She dropped it and it bounced off the floor. No damage. Touch screen makes it easier for her to control. She's 4 and learned quick how to use it. I would definitely recommend this. After buying 3 tablets that broke within months. I finally got it right.
my 2yo loves it this is a great tablet for kids. lots of learning games and some of his favorite cartoons. very easy to use. my son has dropped it already. the case is very protective when it comes to drops.
My 3 year old daughter loves it! Excellent entertainment for children. Very controlled content.

My 5 year old loves her new tablet My daughter wanted this tablet. She couldn‚Äôt wait to get home to start using it. She spent hours quietly exploring. The comfort of knowing she can‚Äôt accidently get on sites not appropariate is the best. We don‚Äôt feel like we have to patrol what she is looking at now.

my son loves it... Pretty sure he is probably playing angry birds with it now.
"My son loves this thing With pre-installed apps, a comfortable and protective case, and a year of Amazon Freetime, this product is worth every penny. The amount of educational programs available for free in Freetime is absolutely staggering. My son suddenly knew things I hadn't taught him, and when I asked him where he learned it, he would open the app and show me. He's three. It boggles the mind."
My Third Kindle Fire This is my third Kindle Fire upgrade and it doesn't disappoint. It is perfect for travel and I would definitely recommend.
My wife loves it I bought this for my wife because her old one broke and she absolutely loves it

New tablet for mom! I bought this tablet for my 80 year old mom. LOVE!
"new tablet with issues Although a new tablet, had some issues. The updates kept it from the freetime. I called tech support and did not solve the issue. I eventually figured out how to resolve the issue, a bug in the tablet os I guess. I now have a great tablet for my 3 year old."
Nice A cheap tablet that will do all of your basic needs. It‚Äôs actually more durable then my other more expensive tables.
"Nice It‚Äôs super big, buys it‚Äôs really clear, sound is good"

Nice and handy tablet Just a perfect tablet for a little girl that loves her movies
"Nice and inexpensive Better than the 7 inch..by an inch, Nice little cheap tablet to use and abuse and not think twice about it."
Nice and Simple Runs out of space fast but is good if you don't need to have a lot of storage.
"NIce Budget Tablet Nice basic tablet for the price. Screen colors are muted and text was not that sharp. But, for the price, it does what I need it to do (surf the web, listen to music, read ebooks, watch movies)."
"Nice budget tablet for a daily/travel use I was little skeptical to order this tablet but after a few days of using it I really started to like it. It is budget tablet for anyone looking to do the basic web activities, games and music. It does not have top end features but with expandable memory you can store a ton of music and videos."
Nice compact tablet Tablet very responsive. Alexa added to system adds to value
Nice deal My second amazon fire 8 collection and I love it. Always wait for black Friday on this deals.
Nice device for beginners Good device with large screen and easy to operate for kids.

"nice gift for basic tablet needs this is not the fastest nor does it have the best display. but then again its a fraction of the expensive tablets. bought this for my folks, they don't need the best as they only use these to watch youtube or use facebook, basic stuff.and the build is very nice too"
Nice kindle fire I would recommend this tablet.Thank you Best Buy for fast delivery and free ship.
Nice little unit Nice unit for the price. Does pretty much what a computer will do without the bulkiness
"Nice pad for the money I had also bought the amazon fire 10"" pad at the same time, I use the smaller one because it fits in the hand better. after using it for a while I purchase 3 more 8"" pads for gifts. the 10"" pad has a better screen display and sound (another good unit for the price)"
nice product Got this for my 80 year old mother. She loves it. She reads books and plays games for now.
"Nice Product I like this for the size, price, expandable memory. I dont like that Im not able to get the same apps on my android phone on this but its cool for what I use it for."
Nice product Is an awesome tablet with plenty of features that made for a perfect gift.
"Nice product. I bought this as a gift for a family member. I had bought three of the same last thanksgiving as gifts as well. It's a great tablet that pretty much serves most tablet needs. But, unlike a lot of Android tablets, it gets updated by amazon and is pretty secure."
"Nice quality I bought it for my daughter she loves it ,resonable price"
"Nice second hand tablet Was lookin get for a tablet to use as an inexpensive second. This one has worked well for me and my needs. Use it when out at the coffee shop and take it in stores when needing to look up information on items. For the price, works very well."
Nice Size! Using as an e-reader pretty much. Got a fantastic sale price at Christmas. Enjoying the purchase!
"Nice small tablet I bought an 8"" Kindle Fire because I started reading more ebooks and my iPad was a little heavy, especially for reading in bed or carrying with me all the time. I wanted something lighter that would give me all the features of my iPad. I chose the Kindle Fire because of the cost, size, features and availability of ebooks. It's working out great. I didn't have any trouble transitioning since I have an Android phone."
"Nice small tablet! Does everything I need it to, connects easily to the internet. Great size to carry along."
Nice tab for kids Good tablet for kids. This has a great interface as well.
Nice tab to have It's cheap compare to other tablets in the market but so far runnig great.
Nice tablet Amazing tablet for mi 4 year old son she is happy!
Nice tablet Bought as a gift. This is the 4th fire tablet ive purchased. Very well made product. Battery life is good. Does averything a tablet is supposed to do..
Nice Tablet Good inexpensive tablet for my daughter. I picked up on Black Friday for 50 bucks. She loves it.
Nice tablet Great tablet for my Grandson. He loves to play games and you tube
"Nice tablet Great tablet for the price. This may not be the fastest tablet, but it has handled any app I've put on it. The only downside is the Amazon add wake up page."
"Nice tablet I bought several of these for my grandkids after watching a video showing the tablet being tossed around and thrown forcibly onto the floor. During this video, the tablet was being abused but kept working without a problem. I hope my grandkids treat their tablets better than the guy in the video treated his but I believe the tablets are durable. The video guy wouldn't even consider throwing his more expensive other brand of tablet because he said he already knew it would break. I also ordered covers made of leather that will turn the tablets on when opened and off (sleep mode) when closed. I like the Alexa app and believe my grandkids will also. The tablet screen is large enough but not too large to handle. The processor is decent and although the operating version is a modified version of Android tailored for Amazon, it works fine. It is easy to use Kindle on this tablet and easy to find free or inexpensive books my grandkids will enjoy. The tablet price was great as well so I was able to give a nice gift to all six grandkids without breaking the bank! I hope the tablets I bought are as durable as the one demonstrated in the video."
"Nice tablet I replaced an old Galaxy Tab 3 with the Fire. It is taking getting used to, but I am excited to see how it works with all the Amazon Brand."
Nice tablet I was having issues with my tablet and wanted to find something less expensive that could give me netflix and my kindle books. This has both and I couldn't pass up the sale price. I like the screen size and so far no issues have come up.
Nice tablet My son love it. He always play using this and no problem at all.
"Nice Tablet Really nice tablet , screen is pretty clear. Useful apps is reason I bought it."
Nice tablet Very nice tablet that I use mostly for playing on apps and searching the internet.
"Nice Tablet Very nice tablet. Nice size, easy to setup. Very pleased with purchase."
Nice tablet Wish it didn't have all of the apps on the home page
"Nice Tablet for kids Great tablet for kids that comes with usage restrictions unlike Ipad. This is the reason i purchased Kindle Fire HD, I am able to limit their tablet usage compare to ipad. It comes with free (1month) Freetime app online books for my kids to read."
Nice tablet for multiple ages This is our second Kindle Fire for kids (we upgraded to the newest version). The screen is a little bit bigger and has the awesome blue light filter built into the screen so I don‚Äôt have to worry as much about my 5 year old‚Äôs eyes and macular degeneration. It has all of the features of the original kids kindle; you can set time limits and reading goals to get more game time. It is durable and our 10 and 11 year old also love theirs as you can customize it to each child‚Äôs specific age group.
"Nice Tablet for the Amazon Ecosystem Love this inexpensive little tablet. It's not the flashiest tablet available, but it works every time and operates well inside the Amazon Ecosystem."
"Nice tablet for the money!!! I have the Samsung tab 10.1and wanted a tablet for outside to read and play games.I didn't want to ruin my good tablet so I bought the fire hd 8 and I have to say I just love it.. it's fast, screen is great and affordable and light to hold.. just buy it and try for youself..."
"Nice Tablet for the Price An excellent tablet for the price. Just remember that Amazon is using it to try to sell you stuff. And not all apps are available in the app store, just the ones Amazon wants you to see"
"Nice tablet for the price It's a nice tablet for the price and I use it for a lot of things around the house , TV , tempeture"
Nice tablet for the price! Got these for Christmas presents. They were well received!
Nice tablet if you are into Amazon! Bought this and a 128gb micro-sd card on Black Friday. Nice size screen that is clear and responsive.. Easy to setup and use. Good sound - better than my Galaxy S7. Battery last a very long time. Excellent tablet and e-reader.
Nice tablet with a few annoying features Overall i like the tablet. However Amazon has set the lock screen with advertisements for their apps and books and you can't change that. I don't care about your ads Amazon!
"Nice tablet, great price This tablet was a excellent price for black Friday. Wish I had purchased two."
Nice tablet. Great purchase for the $$$. Does what I use it for.
Nice! It is a nice product and it took some use to getting to versus my old kindle!
"Niece loves it My niece loves this tablet, and the product works far better than others items that we've bought for her."
Niece's gift Wonderful gift for my niece.She gets entertainment and also gets to use it to learn things.
Niece's gift Wonderful gift for my niece.She gets entertainment and also gets to use it to learn things.
No response I bought four fire tablets and each of them stopped charging immediately after the purchase. I wrote to Best Buy detailing the problem with the tablets and the fact I did not have insurance or the boxes to return the item. No response. Disappointed because I have made major and multiple purchases with this company. Won't make any more purchases from Best Buy.
No summary yet This was purchased as a Christmas gift and I have not had any experience with it yet.
"Not a product for all Playstore apps I got the tablet for $50 but doesn't have the full Android operating system. Even with a software hack, not all the apps from Play Store were usable on this tablet. Returned it and got a Samsung Tablet."
"Not an iPad but at this price, great! Okay; we know this is not an iPad so the horsepower is limited but at the $80 price point ($50 on sale as I write this and as I purchased it), it's a fantastic bargain.Don't let any reviews here claim that you can't run most Android apps (including the Google Play Store and its apps!). You just have to be a little crafty. Follow the instructions here: http://saintlad.com/install-google-play-store-on-kindle-fire/ ...and in 15 minutes, I had the Play Store, Play Books (which means all of the books I had uploaded there now were available on the Kindle). Sure, you can use Amazon's servicesKindle books, videos, buying stuff on Amazonbut you don't -have- to. Note that this unit has the lockscreen ads which, frankly, you see only for 2 seconds before you unlock it; so don't waste your money thinking you have to pay more for the non-ad version. Web surfing isn't as fast as on my iPad but it's fine, really. (And I'm a Mac person.)"
Not as Good as iPad Not as good as iPad with accessibility but still gets the job done
Not bad but it‚Äôs very slow Not really impressed by this item. It is pretty slow.
"Not bad for $50 Bought this for my parents as they have an aging 3rd Generation FireHD. That tablet cost well over $300 dollars but was limited to fireOS 4. I couldn't believe that their newest only cost $50 on sale with ads. I don't think it is worth it at their normal price of $80 dollars.FireOS 5 is pretty much just a skinned version of Android Lolipop. Since we are on Nougat now, they are about two years behind. Hopefully security updates are still being made for the device.The biggest disappointment was the screen. If you buy this for reading books, they really need to go back to the old 3/4 Gen HD Fire Tablets, as their screens are so much better. They claim IPS on this screen, but I don't buy it. Colors are washed out and pixel density is pretty poor.The blue light filter they have is pretty terrible compared to what Apple offers. It basically puts a semitransparent color over the entire screen. If something on the screen is already black, why does it need to look blackish orange? I don't fully fault amazon as this may be more of a limitation of Android, but still...Also I can't figure out how to get rid of the adds for the red version. In the past there was an option to pay a few extra dollars and they remove the promotion. Amazon's website doesn't offer the red without adds as of this writing, but they do with the black.Side load google play store for more up to date apps as a lot of the amazon store apps are long out of date."
"Not bad for the price It's a decent tablet. Good size. Would be better if it could have google play loaded without going through hoops. I don't really like the UI, but it could be worse."
"Not bad for the price. This tablet is pefect for kid travel, reading digital comics, etc. It is just lo Iimited in processing speed."
Not complicated Perfect size light weight and can conceal always..
"Not for Comixology owners - only buy when on sale Bought it for $50 to replace my aging Kindle Fire HDX 7. Was excited about the size (1"" larger), faster processor, and expandable storage.I should have read the reviews. Comixology purchases only download to the internal storage, not external - 16 GB fills up after 8 downloads. The screen resolution is noticeably pixilated when reading text.Still, one star for value if bought for $50, one star for build (solid), and one if you're a Amazon Prime member & able to take advantage of video & music (which will download to external memory)."
"Not for me Returned within a week, did not like it. I didn't care for the ads every time I turned the tablet on."
"not impressed with the Amazon operating system The Unit had good screen resolution and the size was not bad but, Not at all impressed with the Amazon operating system."
Not kid friendly I think the charging port should be something more simple since this product is aimed at smaller children. We‚Äôve only had ours for a month and the port is broke. Getting a new one sent to us.
Not so good screen resolution Good for reading but video quality is not so good.
Not so much of use Couldn‚Äôt use it for video chat with amazon show .. that was the reason for me to buy this tablet. Will return back
Not that great Kid enjoyed using it. It came in handy most of the time.
Not to be modified I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.
"Not too impressed Bought it for my 3 year old son. Physically the product is amazing! Love the case around it, and how amazon replaces the product if anything happens, no questions asked. However, the software is terrible. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but its hard to consider this as a tablet when everything is limited. I only use it now to play movies from an external SD card, which cannot be played via kids profile"
"Not using Is a gift for Christmas, therefore not yet in use."
Ok The Freetime so far isn't very intuitive and it looks like you have to be on the deivce. No web interface for it.
"Ok for daily use This device fulfill a daily needs. You can use for a very basic thing like browsing, listening the music, watching movie or reading. The quality of the picture and the sound is not too bad. If you are a vet picky person.. this device will not work for you. The only cons for me is that this device can't connect to Tv."
"Ok for Kids Cant download many apps, but its great for kids or for those who like to read."
Ok for price Picture quality seemed grainy. We tried streaming video on amazon prime with it and it buffered some times even though we have an extremely fast Wi-Fi. For the price though it's not bad. We use it for our kid's apps
Okay Not reaching my expectations and it's okay to kids to play games
Okay This tablet is what it is for; a child. Overall its an alright tablet. Make sure you set up a parental control pin or you might get a nice bill to your credit card or just don‚Äôt associate your credit card on the tablet!
On the go excellence I love my fire tablet. I like that it was so easy to set-up. I love all the apps I can download. I use it to access Amazon prime books and videos. I use it to borrow books from the public library. This will save me money down the road.
Only one issue so far Just wish i could lock the screen so my daughter cant exit apps!
Our kid loves this This version is larger than the previous. We have had 3 of these now and purchase them as gifts for friends kids. Love that you can limit the screen time.
Our son loves it Very easy to use. Trying to motivate my son to read more. So far is working.
Our son loves it Very easy to use. Trying to motivate my son to read more. So far is working.
Outstanding My 5 year daughter really likes this and I can put parental controls on it so I know what she is watching.
Outstanding Kindle This one was purchased for my sister. I already have one and knew she would enjoy it.
Overall good for wifi users Good for wifi users with affordable low cost. We can buy . Cam clarity is not good. That's cons.
Overall Great Tablet This was a great tablet for my daughter at a reasonable price.
"Perfect This is exactly what my daughter wanted. Easy to use, great case for a 3 year old to drop. And an amazing no questions replacement via Amazon."
"Perfect This is exactly what my daughter wanted. Easy to use, great case for a 3 year old to drop. And an amazing no questions replacement via Amazon."
Perfect Used to have an iPad but I hated it became obsolete. I love my kindle fire and BestBuy was great!!!
Perfect Works great. Perfect for the age a lot of apps to download
Perfect 1st Tablet for Kids! This is by far the best tablet I've ever purchased for my little ones I love it so much and I'm definitely considering buying 1 more in the near future! (I have 2 already but I have 5 little ones all under the age of 10 who constantly fight over the 2 we have now lol)
Perfect and durable Great for kids. Tons of content available. Perfect for learning and long car rides.
"Perfect for 3 year old Easy to hold, loves the pink case, and is able to play and recognize icons and age appropriate games. Great purchase for our 3 year old!"
"Perfect for a beginner Rugged, good quality, many games to play and beginner books to read. My 5 yr old grand daughter absolutely loves it!"
"Perfect for a kid Tablet works great for a 7yr old. He has no trouble using it and playing with it. Simple entertainment for trips, car rides or when the weather is bad outside. Like the parental controls on it also."
Perfect for a toddler! We bought this for our 2 yr old grandson for Christmas. He just loves it. The protective case is very sturdy and can hold up to a toddler. Easy to you and kid friendly.
Perfect for child It's ok just right for our baby I like we can set a lot of parental blocks
Perfect for kids Youd be silly not to buy this for a childs tablet. Comes with a no questions asked 2 yr warranty. Doesnt have special offer ads on it. Can be modded to provide Google play apps but you will miss out on the Amazon child filters for content. Durable and plenty powerful. Price is insanely cheap
Perfect for kids! I absolutely love this tablet. I got it for my 3 year old for Christmas so she wouldn't steal mine all the time. Great for kids i downloaded Netflix and I could download lots of movies and shows so she could watch in the car without having Wifi. Would recommend it to anyone with kids
"Perfect for kids!! This was a gift for my 9 year old daughter. She LOVES my iPad, but I was skeptical on spending that much money on a tablet that may end up....floating in a tub, covered in permanent marker or play doh...you never know. The kids tablets are too juvenile for her. The cheap android tablets break so fast....I am a high Amazon fan, so I went for the Fire. She LOVES it!!! The HD display is better than the iPad mini4. I love how easy it was to set up, and that you can set Amazon family accounts now. She loves using Alexa for everything! I believe I may get myself one too!!"
Perfect for my daughter So happy that you can add a micro SD card! This girl needs as much memory as possible!
"Perfect for on the go! We buy the kindle fire for each of our grandkids as they get old enough and they love, love, love it!"
"perfect for the kid This is awesome for kids, not too pricy, has a great case, and loads of parental controls."
"perfect for the kid This is awesome for kids, not too pricy, has a great case, and loads of parental controls."
"Perfect for the kids Bought 2 of these for my grandkids for Christmas. These are perfect and with the sale I bought them on, even better. I liked the 8 since the screen is a little bigger plus more memory than the 7."
Perfect for toddlers Love item for 2 year old
"Perfect for what I needed it for I grabbed this when it was on sale for Black Friday because it was such a good price. I had a regular Kindle before & traded it in to Amazon with the intention of getting another regular Kindle but I never did. In the meantime I did get an iPad Pro & I thought that would function as my Kindle/e-reader. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my iPad. But the iPad Pro is just way too big to comfortably read in bed (12.9‚Äù) or carry around in my bag to have with me when I expect to be in a waiting room somewhere & might want a book or magazine. It‚Äôs also too big (and too expensive) to bring to the gym to set on the treadmill to watch a TV show while I workout. So I grabbed this Kindle hoping it would be everything my iPad is not. So far it does everything I need it to do. It was easy to set up right out of the box. I easily synced it with my Amazon account so I could pull my books, music, movies, & TV shows right from my Amazon account right away. I did add the Netflix and Hulu apps so I could watch some shows while I worked out. The screen is great. The picture is crisp and clear & way better than I expected. The sound is fantastic. It is easy to read on (which should be no surprise since that it was Kindles are made to do). I like that it integrates so easily with my Goodreads account. I haven‚Äôt spent much time browsing the web on it since that‚Äôs not what I bought it for. So I can‚Äôt speak to how it functions as a traditional tablet. But as an e-reader and media player, it is fantastic. I have had some issues with the SD card alerting me that it has been removed when it wasn‚Äôt, but some research showed me that it is not an uncommon issue with these Kindles & I‚Äôm hopeful that it will be resolved soon. Overall this is a great little tablet. It‚Äôs small & lightweight enough to just throw in my bag & have with me wherever I go. The size is perfect to read a book, but also a great size to watch a movie on when you‚Äôre on the go. It also feels pretty sturdy. I did buy a case for it, but I feel like it‚Äôs pretty solid on its own."
Perfect gift Granddaughter loved it. It was her favorite gift. She couldn‚Äôt wait to get it set up!
Perfect gift for a young adult This was a great birthday gift for our 20s daughter. Just what she wanted
Perfect Kids tablet It‚Äôs really kid friendly and allows for total parental control. My 3 yr old was able to use it right outta the box.
Perfect phone Takes great pics. Easy to maneuver. Good screen size
Perfect size bought and love the size compaired to the other sizes
Perfect size Wanted a tablet easy to hold bigger than my phone smaller than laptop. This is perfect
Perfect size for me! I have finally found the perfect tablet! I got the new Amazon Fire HD8 in yellow! It was in my price range and the size is just right for me! It fits in my purse so I can take it with me everywhere I go.
"Perfect sized tablet Bought for my son and he absolutely loves it. Good selection of games and plenty of factory space, can even install SD card for more if needed"
Perfect tab for kids Cheap and best tab for kids.Good qualitygreat features
Perfect tablet for a child This is the perfect tablet for a beginner. It is sturdy and has everything he needs.
"Perfect tablet for kids I had originally tried getting an At&T or a Sprint tablet for my young daughter but she (or someone else) would inevitably end of breaking the screen and making the tablet unusable. Screen protectors would make the sensitivity too difficult for her to use and I couldn't ever find a good drop-proof protective case.I finally discovered the Amazon Fire Kids edition and wish I had known of this 3 broken tablets ago. Aside from the awesome drop-proof case, it has a nicely done custom kids view that removes all the things I don't want my daughter having access to (Youtube, the Google play store, web browsing). I already had one issue with it (99% certain it was my fault) but Amazon's ""Worry Free Guarantee"" had me a replacement tablet in 2 days for zero cost and no questions asked. If you have a young child you want to get a tablet for, this is it."

Perfect! Excelent choice. I'm just missing the screenshot possibilty.
"PERFECT! I am highly recommending this product, top notch!!"
"Picked this up cheap Although this tablet is not really for everyday normal use due to some of its limitations, I was looking for a good replacement for a very old ipad that was slowing down. Picked this up for less than 40 dollars and really can't complain considering my last ipad was over 500. Good starting tablet or for those that do not need much,"
Poor audio and camera It was affordable but does not meet features that you need for videos callinh.
Pretty good A good tablet for the price just need a bigger memory card
pretty good considering price Addition of Google play store would be added value.
"Pretty good for the kids For what it is, it's great. If you expect an iPad, you're not going to get it. It's a very capable tablet, and has a good variety of apps for the kids."
"Pretty good for the kids For what it is, it's great. If you expect an iPad, you're not going to get it. It's a very capable tablet, and has a good variety of apps for the kids."
"Pretty good tablet When my mom mentioned initially that she wanted a tablet I never thought of getting her an Amazon tab. At some point she saw it and decided she wanted one The tablet, firstly is an Amazon tab so it doesn't automatically come with the Google play store which can be a bummer for persons who are used to an android system. I found a way around that so now her tablet has the Google play store. It does have annoying ads for books at times. Maybe that can be turned off. Not sure yet For the most part it definitely handles her demands which include banking, emails and YouTube so it's so far so good"
"Pretty good tablet for kids Got this for my kids this xmas (3 yr old twins). They absolutely love it and have become very adept at navigating everything (ridiculously easy for them which is a little scary). They've dropped it many times and the cushion on this thing has paid for itself already. Lots of kid-friendly apps - although it seems like you can only pick from their set list of apps - this might be an android/amazon thing I haven't figured out yet. My only complaint is it can be a little slow sometimes, particularly with downloading apps. Sometimes it shows the icon for an app like you have it, but then when they click it the wheels start spinning and it begins downloading, and it takes a couple of minutes (whereas my iPad would do it in about 15 sec). I don't mind the wait, but 3 yr olds get impatient quick. At least it's teaching them patience if not anything else. :)"
Purchased for a gift I purchase as a gift for my daughter. She loves it.
"Purchased for a novice Bought this for my 87 year old mother-in-law who wanted to use something for word games, etc. She's still getting used to it but she'll learn."
Purchased for Christmas presents Just right for my under 10 nieces and nephew. Great investment.
"Purchased for my grandchildren‚Äôs Xmas I am the purchaser, not the user, but have owned a Kindle myself. These products are very reliable & easy to use."
"Purchased for Sister In Law Was a perfect purchase to get her as she was getting tired of looking at stuff on her small phone screen, just a basic android tablet that has the benefits of others and at a really great price on black friday."
Quality device Great tablet for a low cost. Dependable and with all the Right Software.
Quality machine for the price paid Amazon product is everything you expect it to do. It has a nice sturdy feel incapabilities two rival some of the best out there. the only drawback is the proprietary operating system and method of downloading apps can seem a little bit clunky at times but with some playing around with you get used to it.
"Real good Nice tablet to work - Works perfectly, Rock solid."
Really Good This product is very good to use .I recommend for my friends.Very easy to use
"Really good kindle Very good product, the touch sensitivity is excellent compared to recent one we have owned."
Really love the big screen the person who received this tablet is enjoying such a big screen. They are still exploring all the new options.
"Really Sleek and great value Love the Tablet. Great for reading, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify etc...My only gripe is the Amazon App store isn't as populated as the Google Play store. I use mine every day. Setup was a breeze and I got them for my whole family!"
Really slim and easy to carry I purchased this tablet because my classes required online textbooks and this tablet made it so easy to access everything I need. I love how lightweight it is and how I'm able to access the internet as well.
"Reliable product This was a nice purchase for my son 8yr old, it performs well"
Replace item for child exactly what I needed Better than the original tablet we lost. Was in stock & at a great price. Called & could pick up in a few hours
Replaced an old tablet Have had an Amazon Fire for several years. Upgraded to a new one. Easy to use! Affordable!
Replacement Kindle for my wife. Needed to get a replacement Kindle for my wife. Did a lot of research online about new generation models of Kindles and sizes. Best Buy had all the models and sizes in stock. And their price was the same as everyone else.
Returned I returned this item because I couldn‚Äôt get a keyboard with a case to go with it.
RETURNED Tried to watch youtube and other video from different sources but it was horrible. The sound would lag w or 3 seconds behind the viewing. Returned for Samsung S2 tablet which is wonderful. You get what you pay for.
"Right size for my needs My 87 year old father used an earlier version for his reading enjoyment with limited tech ability. I got the 8"" version and it fits my hand and is an enjoyable and functional tablet."
Road Trip Saver We bought this for my son to watch his videos on the road when traveling and it has been a lifesaver. Very kid friendly.
"Rugged Bought for my 4 year old a few months ago, very rugged and kid friendly. He can navigate through the device without issues. Comes with a nice kid friendly case that keeps it safe from drops."
sale price 59.99 For the price. Its great!!! I would buy another one if it goes on sale again
Seems to be working good No problems charging (yet) or holding a charge. Its only been almost a month so don't want to jump the gun yet.
Should have bought one sooner Very pleased with the product and performance. Easy and fast to download content - such as movies and music. Took on a recent trip and now wished I had bought one sooner - fits right in back pocket of my DSLR camera bag. Only draw back was unexplained power loss - as described by other reviewers. After a day it came right back on - suggest it might be a recharging problem as after a full charge it is working fine again. For the price and content available - great buy.
Simple Great tablet for kids and elders. Easy to use. Nothing fancy about it. It just gets the simplest of task done at a great price. Had for 1 week and it has had no issues.
"simple and cheap to buy You really cant beat the value of Kindle Fire tablets. You get decent specs for under $80. The speakers are decent, the screen isn't bad, and there are quite a few apps available. Obviously this doesn't compare with the quality of an Ipad Mini (except the sound on this may be better than Ipad mini 2 and similar to Ipad mini 4), but you are paying 1/3 of the price as well. If you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, like my mother is, this is a great little tablet. I purchased this to replace my mother's 3 year old Kindle Fire HD7. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but the new one runs the newer apps much quicker."
"Simple reader, very easy to use Bright screen has micro ad port. Works with my 17 Gbyte card."
Simple to use Great price for an easy to use tablet. Excellent for reading ebooks.
"Size is great I purchased this Kindle for my mother and she absolutely loves it. She can play games, look at the Internet and read books. Perfect."
"Slick, for now For the price, it is quite a nice tablet. I must admit there's little I've done with it for now, the goal being to get it to the kids to control their Lego Boost kit with it."
"Slim and quick nice slim design, easy to hold, easy to set up. bought for my husband...he just likes to browse the internet. great for him!"
Slow at first When I finally opened and started the process it took forever to load apps but when it finally finished it was fine
Slow but durable Kindle fire is slow but love the fact my child is protected from some internet content
"small but might good for doing some things and just a quick computer, try it"
So far OK 1st Fire tablet. The color and screen are nice and bright. The ability to set the turn on time for night screen is nice.Miss not having some of the true Android apps like Firefox . May be the learning curve but the Silk browser header is always in the way.
So far so good This was to replace an earlier gen Kindle. That one would just shut down. We have not had any concerns with this and I will say I like the design better.
"So far, so good I fired up my Fire today. It seemed to go well very well."
"So far, so good So far, so good, but I've only used it for 1 week. Would've like for some kind of handle for the cover so it's easier to hold for kids small hands."
"Solid budget tablet - one major flaw Context: Replacement for my old Nexus 7; bought during black friday/cyber monday sale.Pros:-Literally the only decent android tablet for its price.-Good battery life.Cons:-No access to google play apps/services (youtube, gmail, etc only via browser).-First one I purchased had a defective speaker - QC might be variable.Thoughts:Amazon's insistence on using their own app store/android version is annoying, as is the subsequent lack of core google apps. However, for the price there is very little competition among android tablets."
Solid computer My 11 year old loves it. He likes the look and it loads videos quickly.
Solid kids tablet Much better than the cheaper $50 tablets out there.
"Solid tablet This is a solid tablet for the money, great size, easy to use"
"Solid tablet with Alexa a bonus. Great resolution for video. Easily connects to Firestick to throw what you are looking at on your tablet on to the TV. Easy interface. Amazon app store not as good as Google play, but close."
Son loves it Bought this for my 3 year old. He absolutely loves it. It is easy for him to navigate
Son tablet My son loves this tablet and so does his mom lol..
Son tablet My son loves this tablet and so does his mom lol..
"SORRY, HAD TO RETURN IT. NOT REALLY NEEDED. I ALREADY HAD TWO AND DECIDED THREE WAS OVERLY ONE TOO MUCH."
"Sounds Poor and internet reception fair to poor Quite complex and troublesome, with poor features. It does not store music or file and keep ponying to various sites"
"Still up in the air Resolution was great, speed was good. Bought for grandson, he didn't like it because it would not run Google apps and couldn't watch u-tube without purchasing additional apps."
"Stopped charging in under 6 months The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!"
Sturdy Kid's Tablet I've finally found a tablet that fits the needs of my granddaughter.
Super nice Super nice and affordable great price excellent quality and works just as good as an iPad or android tablet
"Surprisingly good Bought it for my kids. Never bought Amazon tablets before because Youtube kids is a must have. However, installing Google Playstore, framework and services was surprisingly easy and from there was just easy. There was an excellent list of games and entertainment on Amazon store and integration with my Prime account was extremely simple. Price point for the performance and quality of this tablet $49.99 8"" 16GB & $79.99 32GB) against most other ordinary name tablets which are $100+ is outstanding. Presence of ads and other material really isn't a problem and well worth the discount I'm very happy."
"Sweet Little Tablet Purchased for my grandson for Christmas. Comes charged and ready to setup. Setup process is relatively painless, though it does require an Amazon account and payment source. The display is bright and sharp and response snappy. Available memory from the indicated 16 GB is around 10 GB after stock apps and operating system space allotted. For daily use that should be sufficient but downloaded content (not necessarily application) can be stored on a micro SD card (not included). All in all I'm very pleased with this purchase. Should my opinion change after Christmas, I'll let you know. ;)"
Tablet Absolutely love the product my first child had one. My second child asks for one .Now on my fourth kid and they want the same one. Nice product . And my husband do not mind getting it for the price .
Tablet Best tablet ever and our daughter loves the different color.
Tablet Best tablet ever. Great for kids. You can put tons of apps on it.
Tablet Bought this for my son and he loves it. And I love that he can throw it around and not break!
Tablet I love how it helps my sister with her homework and have her entertained.
"Tablet Not a good tablet for kids. To avoid ads from appearing, you must pay 15 dollars."
Tablet Perfect to use with the firestick...my daughter will be so happy with her Christmas present!
Tablet Upgrade for my granddaughter she loves the color and she likes watching her movies on it
Tablet Was looking for a reasonably priced tablet for the kids. Comes with a protected case and easy to use
Tablet We have only had this product for about a month and there's already a problem with the charging port. Having to send it back. My Daycare owns 3 of them for her own children and their having the same problems with two of there's.
Tablet extraordinaire Good quality tablet that does what it needs to do for not alot of money
"Tablet has come along way!! I purchased this tablet for my girlfriend who had the original Amazon Tablet that just stopped working. So from what she says it's really fast, easy to use, loves the Alexa and claims that the picture quality is amazing."
Tablet was a gift for my mom Got the tablet for my mom for christmas! She absolutely loves it!!
Tblet I bought for one of my children. They really like it. Simple to use and inexpensive
"Terrible. Not worth it! I mainly got this to have a bigger screen to read my news on. My favorite news app refused to open! Only good was that I have amazon prime. However, I returned the fire tablet and got the iPad 2017. Much happier with that!!"
Terrific value Awesome tablet for beginners and pros for surfing and basics .
"The Best for Internet navegation Is my Best divice. Internet uses for social media, online music, reading, clud storage, photo, etc."
The best gift ever My grandkids love Thur tablets they are a very sturdy educational tool to have they keep them very calm and it's less fighting I have blue for the boys and pink for the girls they are absolutely the best and the price was awsome ....Thanks Best buy
"The best if you‚Äôre on a budget If you‚Äôre on a budget or media consumption is your only use, then this is the best you can get. The Amazon bloat can slow down the device, not to mention the restrictions imposed but at this price, you get what you pay for"
"The best kid tablet Its a perfect device and secure device for kids, just love it."
The best kindle fire I have had. HD is great! This one has a beautiful screen I love the 8 inch HD. It's as nice as any fire I've ever had and I've had three. I particularly love listening to books but don't always want to pay the audio book prices. His Kindle has is going to voices any ever has but it's mostly the same as the last fire they came out before it. I love the different color choices and I love the kid's case the best even for a grown-up. You can't beat the price for an android tablet and also it goes on sale now and again and get even cheaper and more affordable.
the best tablet for the price This tablet is amazing. Just easy to use and for $49.99 you can't beat the price.
THE EXTRA STORAGE SPACE HELPS ALOT. I HAVE ALOT OF MOVIES AND VIDEOS THAT I HAVE TO STORE AND THE 32 GB REALLY IS A GREAT FEATURE
"The Fire is hot after downloading the Nook app, I now have both a kindle reader and Nook reader in the same device"
The price is amazing For 50 bucks you can't do better than this. It's quite the tablet
"There is a santa I bought this for my special needs son. He keeps kissing it saying,"" I love you tablet"". Could not be happier. Setup is a breeze. Very easy forkids to use and enjoy."
These were a hit for Christmas for the kids My kids were using ipods that would no longer work with some newer apps. These were cost effective upgrades. They use them constantly for games and netflix. I was able to get the google play store app installed for games not available on Amazon.
Third fire Fire is great for books also good for photos and google
This is a basic tablet for someone that doesn't re I got this for my boyfriend for a Christmas gift. He liked it but doesn't use the internet much & has a smart phone so I returned. It's good for someone looking for something basic
This is great My tablet is worth the money I spent. Great job!!!
This is pretty user friendly This has been pretty easy for my kids to use and navigate. They really like it.
"This tablet is great for kids This tablet is great for kids. I love all the different kids content available. The only negative thing I have noticed so far is that at time it will freeze up and I end up having to reboot to fix it. So far, that's the only issue."
This tablet is great for reading My son love's his tablet he uses it for reading and playing games
This was a gift This was a gift for grandkids. I'm hearing that they are very happy with it.
This was a gift This was a gift for grandkids. I'm hearing that they are very happy with it.
This works great for my kid This one has not gave us any trouble unlike the one my daughter uses. My son loves playing his kid friendly games
time a read this item is very conv. for the time to read a good book or just to let the book read to you.
Toddler first tablet I bought this for my son and he is able to easily navigate along safe for Kids!
Too many amazon adds OK for the price. Used for games and checking emails. Haven't explored other uses at this time
Too simple Not enough features. It's to simple. When parental control is on it's not much you can do on the tablet not even use the camera
TOUGH AS NAILS TABLET We have our son Christian with autism he needs a tablet that can with stand being dropped these TABLETS are tough as nails.
TOUGH AS NAILS TABLET We have our son Christian with autism he needs a tablet that can with stand being dropped these TABLETS are tough as nails.
"Trying something new! We have had cell phone service tablets for years, our kids need kid tablets. We bought 2! So cute and a great price..."
Un-expected I had an older Kindle Fire and thought the transition to this one would be smooth. I was even encouraged to turn in my old one one the spot. After cleaning up the old one and saving the old files on the cloud I thought....I bought this updated version to find that it does not recognize the old files....so much for it being saved on the cloud. Then instead of it having an ad whenever I turn it on....ads also clutter the screen with the apps. I was happier with the older model and regret turning it in for a credit....which somehow dropped $10 in value in the time it took me to prep it before I deregistered it. If you didn't have an older model you probably will be happy with this one.
Unit failed and Amazon will not support I have had this product less than 6 months. It shut down unexpectedly and would not restart. I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty.
Upgrade from 7 to 8 Well pleased with this upgrade purchase for husband! He loved his Fire 7 & loves his Fire HD 8 even more!
Upgrade Wife's Kindle Wife loves her Kindle and has used it for years. Thought it was time to update to take advantage of new features and bigger display.
Upgraded Had the smaller version decided to upgrade to the next size!
Upgraded my old Kindle Upgraded my old Kindle when Best Buy offered this on a Flash Deal for 49.99 great buy. like the alexa function makes navigation much easier
User friendly I purchased the Kids kindle because of the warranty plan. Thinking it's the best deal for the money. I find it in no way user friendly for my ha me or my 3 year old granddaughter! She can take my iPad go strength to her folder.

Using it in the jeep using it as a head unit in my jeep bought a rugged case and it works great
"Value for money Amazon Fire HD8 is a good tab at this price. It's light in weight, easy to use and serves a good purpose for browsing and reading. But if you are looking for a good camera or a tab for video calling, this is not the right choice for you"
VERY COMFORTABLE IN YOUR HAND AND LIGHT WEIGHT .. TAKES GREAT QUALITY PICTURES. WILL BUY AGAIN. LOVE IT.
Very cool Much faster and clearer than our fire 6. Really easy to use!
Very durable Great to use for my little one. She loves it awesome
Very durable Great to use for my little one. She loves it awesome
Very durable easy to use Purchased this for my children they love it varies the navigate for them holds a charge well
Very durable tablet I got this for my daughters 5 birthday. Better than her old leap pad. I think she enjoys it more because the display is more like my phone. VERY happy kid!!
Very easy to use for kids Good gift for kids. My son likes to play the educational games i downloaded for him
"Very fast and smooth product This is a nice one, very fast and smooth for daily operation."
Very fun Amazon fire tablet is an outstanding piece of equipment. Strongly recommend.
"very good so far my mom loves it it was gift for her, it's fast and simple"
"Very good for my child My son loves his ""tabwet"" lol. Hes got plenty of PJ Masks episodes and games plus much more."
"Very good for my child My son loves his ""tabwet"" lol. Hes got plenty of PJ Masks episodes and games plus much more."
"Very Good Inexpensive Tablet My wife's Ipad Mini had issues, she wore it flat out, and wanted to get another one but did not want to spend the money on a new iPad, so we gave this one a try. After BB Reward Zone $ I got it for about $100ish with 32gb of memory.To be clear, this is not on the same level as the iPad mini but it was not designed to. Technical specs not quite as good but for $100ish dollars from a reputable company it is not bad at all. The first thing to note is that it does not come with the ability to download from the Google Play Store. You can can get around this by side loading Google and there are plenty of websites to tell you how to this very easily.My wife has been burning it up with this tablet and she really likes it. She can let go of some of the shortcomings vs the iPad mini. Overall she likes it, which is good.So if you are wanting an inexpensive tablet from reliable company, try the Fire tablet."
Very good price I have a long time with the battery life.. love the fire tablet
"Very good price and easy to use I bought this computer a 32 GB fire for $79 and I love it.I don't do much on it but; emails, play games both on and off line, and go online for other social media like youtube etc.It takes pretty good pictures. It comes on a little slower than I would like, but it is a great buy for me. Once it comes on it is very fast."
"Very good product. Very good product, Good price, I would recommend this product"
"Very good table for the price Good tablet for surfing the internet, shopping online, or games."
Very good tablet and good price When I purchased the Amazon fire tablet I was not expecting it to do everything that my iPad mini did before I broke it but this tablet is a little bit better to me with getting on sites quickly
"Very good tablet at a very low cost Kid was buggin me for a tablet, he already cracked the screen on a couple of other Ipads, this one is a whole lot cheaper and works just about the same."
Very good tablet for kids Very good first tablet for kids without breaking the bank. Have had no issues and the kids love them (ages 3 and 5)
Very good! Its a very nice tablet if you use it for basic stuff. And does alot if things. I love it
Very handy Our daughter loves it. Has helped keep her engaged with the games and shows while traveling and running errands
Very handy - instant access This is a great tablet. Very convenient. Great for instant access to information and the Internet when you don't want to fire up a desktop. Lots of software apps are available for downloading.
Very nice for the money Bought for my son and he loves it. The price was great and the features are awesome. Thinking about one for myself in the near future.
Very nice for the money Got this for my daughter when it was on sale. She really likes it. It seems to be slow charging but the battery lasts a long time.
Very Nice! A very nice movie watching tablet. Perfect size for watching in bed
Very nice. This is handy to have for quick searches and candy crush.
Very Satisfied! Very satisfied with this product. It is actually for my husband. He uses it mainly with his ‚Äúyou-tube‚Äù videos. Loves it. Always in it. It lasted longer than the last one he got from another competitor.
"Very slow , resolution bad It's 2017 no reason this tablet cannot produce clear 1080 or higher resolution. I get it it's cheap and for that it's good but it just feels cheap and omg so manny pop up adds.. Comeon amazon"
Volume is low For the most part the Kindle 8 is a great deal for the money. The volume was giving me a problem but it was resolved quickly by Amazon. Overall quite happy
Was recommended Had the smaller Kindle for years and now I'm enjoying the Kindle 8 with the additional features.
"Was shopping for an e-reader, but... Had been shopping for an e-reader, checking them all out, reviews, etc., and decided to just check out the tablets. Came across the Fire HD 8. Many more uses, versatile, really good as an e-reader, AND a lower price. Very satisfied with this purchase."
Was very impressed with this Kindle. Was able to do majority of our Christmas shopping at Best Buy. Bought three Kindles for presents.
"waste of money Waste of money,You tube does not work on these tablets,so everything from there old tablet does not work on the new ones,so going back to the old ones and sending these back"
We love them We enjoy them. They are easy to use. We would recommend
"We really love !! This our first tablet so can't really compare them to all I know is we are enjoying them great for reading, games checking e-mail ."
Who wouldn't want a Kindle I bought this item for a gift. I've owned one for years and i have no complaints. I mostly use mine for reading books and playing games.
"wife loves it. Works great for reading books, searching the web and some games."
"Wife Loves this Tablet Bought this for my wife to replace a Nexus 7 that had seen much better days. This is part of the Amazon ecosystem of course, but she has found it to be a great, intuitive tablet that fulfills all of her modest tech needs."
"Will be a Christmas gift Cannot provide feedback, it is currently wrapped for Christmas. Will be a gift for an 8 year old"
"Wonderful Best Amazon tablet I've ever owned. While it can't quite beat out my Kindle Voyage for reading, that's hardly a crime."
"Wonderful I can't believe how much I can do with this. I read the Washington Post every morning. I watch BritBox and Netflix on it. I read books, go online, take photos, play games. I would recommend this for anyone."
Wonderful I have a 7 inch Kindle but this is larger with clearer picture
Wonderful for 3 year old Limited time by Mom but she says he loves it a lot
Wonderful for 3 year old Limited time by Mom but she says he loves it a lot
"Wonderful Kindle for our ten year old. Not only I'd we get a larger screen size but, also doubled memory."
Wonderful tablet I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.
Wonderful tablet for kids We bought the 16Gb 7‚Äù tablet for my daughter two years ago and she loved it and still makes use of it. We got these two for her and our son as they are a little bigger and has more space. Can‚Äôt wait to see their faces on Christmas Day. The free time subscription offers a lot of content and for a few dollars a month it‚Äôs worth it. Also the ability to lock down what they watch and for how long is a great feature.We can say only after reading books for 30 mins then can videos be played. My wife and I both love these tablets for our kids.
Working great So many new features compared to my old Kindle from 4yrs ago
Works Speakers stuck on this thing . I bought it to give to my grandma but she found it too difficult.
"Works but had ads The tablet itself works great, but be aware, this is one that comes with ads as your home screen... nowhere did it say that it had ads..."
"Works exactly as I need I didn't need a super expensive tablet, I just needed a basic one for couple different apps I needed. This one works perfect. Need a basic tablet for Netflix or Hulu or Amazon this works great. But don't expect it to be Ipad."
works for dementia patients too We bout this kids kindle actually for my mother with dementia. It is simple enough for her to use yet protects her from unwanted purchases and becoming too overwhelmed. The cover is a nice touch and there are pre-loaded games and apps. Not really worth the price difference though. I did it for connivence sake but probably a better investment to purchase a regular kindle and the case separately. I'm sure there's an app or settings that can make any device kid-friendly. The screen is clear and there's no lag when pushing buttons.
"Works for me! I purchased this to replace my older tablet that was starting to slow down. So far this one is working fine. There is an advertisement at the beginning, but that‚Äôs not a big deal for me."
Works good My son loves it. Very easy for him to use. It's pretty durable as well.
Works great Amazing tablet for the money. Gave one to my wife for Christmas and she loves it
Works great Bought at best buy because I had a rewards certificate. Didn't have color I wanted but still works great.
Works Great I bought 4 of these tablets this Christmas as gifts and they work as expected
"Works great Old fire tablet finally died. Got this one at Best Buy, didn't have to wait two days....and was same price...Works better than old one too."
"Works great Purchased for my mother, easy to set up and works great!"
Works great Works great! Ton's of space for my books. Great portability.
Works great for the price. It's a descent tablet for basic web browsing and videos.
works great! Works great. I have no complaints with this item. My grandaughter is happy with it.
Works well Easy to use. Great for checking out books from library .
works well had one before but it went wacky after 5 years. seems to work well so far.
"Works well The Kindle Fire works well and I enjoy reading on it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems silly to restrict people from reading Nook books on it just because it is a different platform. As a book lover, I like supporting bookstores not only the almighty Amazon. Yes, I know there are ways to get around the restriction. The reason to reduce a point is not based on the excellence of this Kindle, but on politics of sharing."
Worth the purchase Easy to set up. I havent given it to my daughter yet... as I am afraid she will turn into a screen freak but I will be using it for lo g car rides.
"would reccomend was easy to setup, got connected on wifi, then started downloading books"
"Wow for less I bought for wife and she loves it. Not as good as Ipad but for the price one could not get better. Battery lasts and no game crashes. Prime is a plus for all the perks. No need to install Google Play, Prime store rocks."
"X-Mas gift for myself For $49, this is perfect for my game room. I can utilize vs. my smaller iPhone screen. Wish I wasn‚Äôt bouncing between OS‚Äô, but at this price, STEAL!"
Yes I love it. I‚Äôm so glade they made this tablet with protection. Love that my child can watch movies learn and play kid games.

"You Don't Have to Have and iPad to Enjoy a Tablet. First, the bad. I hate the advertisements and the fact that you can't access the vast library of Android apps via Google Play. Nevertheless, you can do most of the things on the Internet that you need to while still have access to Amazon Fire-friendly apps that will keep you informed and entertained. The good news is that the HD8 has an expansion slot for a microSD card and increasing storage space is where the Fire HD8 dances all over the iPad. Add in a 128GB microSD card and you'll have tons of room for audiobooks, ebooks, music files, photos, and videos. The HD8 also has Amazon Alexa in case you're looking for automated help to shop or move around from interest online or on your Kindle Fire.It's a good buy - especially if you buy one when they are on sale!"
You got to get one! Bought for grand daughters birthday after her tablet broke. She loves it! Only downside she can not get on YouTube. Love that it coverts to a parent tablet as well.
Your kids will love it I‚Äôm happy I got this tab for my daughter as a Xmas gift she‚Äôs in love with it!
1st time user Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.
2nd Kindle This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better.
"2nd purchase First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
A book readers best friend I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
"A good cheap tablet. I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
A good tablet for this price.. I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.
"A great 7 inch tablet at a great price This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations."
A great tablet at a fabulous price I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
A great value for the product The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.
a simple machine this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
All around great!! Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
All I needed. Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.
"All in One Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements."
Alot of changes since my 1st Kindle fire I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
Always a great tablet. I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
Always in the go It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet 16gb Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
Amazon Fire Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
Amazon Fire I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.

Amazon fire 7 This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
"Amazon fire 7 for kids This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
amazon fire 7 inch tablet amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues

"Amazon Fire is a great starter tablet. The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos."

Amazon Fire Tablet This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.
Amazon is on Fire The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
An ok tablet It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
Another Table Replacement! Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.
"Appears good but should come with instruction book I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
As expected I purchased I purchased for reading. It has been everything I have expected.
As good as other tablets Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.
"Awesome Awesome.. Everything I need and more. I'm very happy with the tablet.I'm very happy.Thank you,Kathleen Stroyek"
Awesome I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!
awesome for games and movies Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.
Awesome for new tablet user. I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!
"Awesome tablet for the price Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
"Awesome!!! If you are a Amazon Prime member, this is one of the best tablets to have, awesome!"
bang for the buck for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
Basic tablet. Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.
Basic tablet/reader Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
"Beats carrying multiple books After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
Beautiful item very good tablet .i like it. but regulation is little low.
"Best 7"" Kindle ever I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!"
Best gift for the wife ever. My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
"Best Tablet for tweens This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends."
Best tablet on the market for the money I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
Better every generation Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
Better then I expected. I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.
"Bought for my 24 year old daughter, she LOVES it!! It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her."
Bought for wife Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
Bought Kindle for my son He and his wife are delighted with it and the acess to the huge number of books available.
"Came in for a charger, bought a new phone - G7 Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer."
Charging Port Does Not Last - Not good for kids! I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
"Cheap This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
"Cheap but functional device Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices."
Christmas Gift I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
Christmas Gift I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
"Christmas Gift for Mom This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
Confused The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
"Confusing for me; returning I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
"Cost to benefit ratio great My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
Crashed after update My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
Daughter loves it My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.
"Daughter loves this gift tablet! 23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her."
Decent Tablet This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
Decent tablet for the money I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
DER Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.
Did not read reviews. My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
"didn't keep long but downgraded This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
Disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
"Disappointed Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
"Does a lot This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
Does exactly what I needed it for Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.
"Does it's job Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
Does the job My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
Does what I purchased it for. Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.
Does what I want A good product that provides the services I desire.
Dropbox Problem I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
Durable Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
East to use I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
Easy access to my magazines and books. Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
"Easy enough for Grandpa Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
Easy Setup Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
Easy start up All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.
Easy to access and set up. Love its simplicity. Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.
"Easy to hold and use. Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use."
"Easy to read with Fire The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process."
Easy to use Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too
Easy to use I am happy to have udated my fire! I love having the camera work the way it should. WAy to use.
Easy to use I love it. It is so easy to use and great apps to.
"easy to use purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!"
"Easy to use The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price."
Easy to use This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.
Easy to use Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.
"Easy to use, love it I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use."
Easy to use! This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.
Easy to use. Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.
Easy to used it .. I brought to my 2 nices and so far they are enjoy it ....
Efficient Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!)
Entertainment for my mom I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
Entertainment! Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.
"EXCELLENT Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
Excellent Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
EXCELLENT This tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on.
"Excellent choice! Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast."
"Excellent for Amazon product users and shoppers. Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
Excellent for Monitoring the kids!! I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
Excellent for the cost. I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
"Excellent for those entering the tablet world. This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
excellent item It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use
"Excellent low cost tablet This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version"
Excellent Product I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
Excellent Product Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
"Excellent product for the money. It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
Excellent Product For The Price Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
Excellent Product For The Price Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
excellent tablet bought it for my son. he likes it. very good alternate to expensive tables out there.
Excellent tablet I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.
Excellent tablet I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.
excellent tablet Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
Excellent tablet Christmas gift for my niece Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase
Excellent tablet for the money You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
Excellent tablet forever I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good
"Excellent tablet/reader for travel I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet."
Family Tablet We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
Fantastic Tablet Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
Fantastic tablet for reading This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.
Fantastic tablet for simplicity Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!
Fantastic tablet! I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
Fantastic tablet! I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
Fine It's a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it's not what I was thought it's going to be I returned it back just be of this reason
"Fine for Books Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
Fine for what we need Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
Fire 7 Tablet It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
"fire is easy to use. convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
Fire tablet Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
Fire tablet Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
Fire Tablet I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.
Fire Tablet I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
Fire! Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!
Fits I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
Fits perfectly in my hand I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
For my grandson. He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
For my son.... I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
Frees up parents phones Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
Fun Product! Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
Functional at a good deal. I'm normally an Apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the Amazon Fire is.
"gift I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader."
Gift for mom Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.
Glad I purchased this item I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it
Good Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
Good I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet
"Good and cheap Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy"
Good as long as it is plugged in to outlet. Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
"Good Cheap Tablet Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
Good deal Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
Good Deal Liked the first one so much I bought one for the wife
GOOD DEAL Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
good deal and on sale too! Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
Good device Nice device I like to use it to read books online.
Good entertainment Kids love it! Great Christmas present even if not an apple product.
Good experience & customer service Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
"Good first tablet for kids Bought this for my 3rd grader when her school suggested to parents to get a tablet, they use them occasionally in school. This inexpensive one fits the bill just fine."
"Good For a Cheap Tablet Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
"Good for children I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
"good for emails and social media I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes."
"Good for first time kindle owner I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
Good for its money. Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
Good for kids Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.
Good for kids We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
Good for kids to use Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
Good for my 11 year old son My son uses the device to help him do his homework
"Good for reading and internet. I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy."
"Good for reading and simple homework. Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
"Good for reading book. Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small."
Good for the beginner Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
"Good for the money For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
Good for the money While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
"Good for the price Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
Good for the price Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
Good fun The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.
Good laptop for the price It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
Good little tablet Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
"Good little tablet Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics"
Good one to play with The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
Good picture and sound quality Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.
good present for brother my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
Good price My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.
"Good price Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook"
Good product My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
Good product Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear
Good product Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
"good product works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
"Good Reader I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
"good stuff I am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price"
Good tablet Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.
Good tablet I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
"Good Tablet Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge."
Good tablet This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.
Good tablet for amazon users This tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users. Not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users
"Good tablet for average use The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
"Good tablet for kids Good tablet for the price, and excellent for kids."
Good tablet for my 6 yr old. This tablet is perfect for my six year old's learning apps.
"good tablet for that price For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good"
Good tablet for the price This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.
Good tablet for the price range Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
good tablet to star is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
"Good Tablet With Lots of Features This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account."
"Good tablet. I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
good tabllet for the money I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
good value I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top
"good value It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine"
"Good value Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
"Good, but can be better It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
"Got Grandsons? We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
Got this for my 3 year old Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!
Great Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.
Great Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.
Great I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
Great IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend.
Great Like how I was able to buy a version with more memory. Love this works great.

Great This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun
"Great & Easy to Use. I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games."
Great 16GB Tablet For the Price This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.
Great 4 kids Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
"great affordable tablet I'm very pleased with my Kindle fire. I've used it more than I thought I would, as I primarily was getting it for reading, but wanted the internet access and ability to review and edit documents, too. In addition to reading more lately than I usually do, I'm also turning my Fire on instead of my desk top computer if I'm only going to use it a short time."
Great Alternative to Ipad I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
"Great Amazon product Love my kindle it's the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating"
Great and simple to use for anyone. My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
"Great apps for kids I got it just for my son and he can get on and play games and watch videos no problem, the parental controls are amazing and keep him in his specific apps"
Great beginner tablet Bought these for all the grandkids for Christmas. Basic enough for a 10 year old but with enough features and capability for the 18 year old!
Great beginner tablet Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
"Great beginner tablet. I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money."
"Great Big Thank YOU, I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is ""Mom, you are the best"", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!"
great birthday gift I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
Great Bluetooth device for audible books I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.
"Great buddie I'm enjoying my amazon fire. I've been reading great books, checking my e-mail and shopping.I highly recommend this product..value great quality great.You won't be disappointed."
Great buy Bought for my children. Holds plenty of apps. Safe to use with parental controls. Pretty durable but definitely recommend buying a screensaver and case for it.
Great buy I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
"Great buy Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
Great camera GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
"Great camera Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy"
Great cheap tablet I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.
"Great Christmas gift! My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
great color Love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what I needed it for great price
great color screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
Great color Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
Great computer for gamer It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
"Great deal on a great basic tablet This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them."
great device for my needs I bought this to stream HD music via bluetooth to my stereo. Works great and for the price offered can't be beat.
"Great device for reading and playing games. Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
Great E reader This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.
"Great e-reader If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
Great e-reader! Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!
"Great entry level tablet Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound."
"Great Entry Level Tablet This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
Great Find Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus. Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas
Great First Tablet I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.
"Great first tablet for beginners. It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store."

Great for reading! I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.

Great gift for my Grandmother! I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
"Great gift for teens My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price."
"great gift for young teen Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it.

"Great item I bought the fire because I had heard it was a good tablet. So when I bought it, I was wondering if it lived up to the hype. It does. Its fast and easy to use. I put Netflix on it and watch series I missed. Only downside is that I had to register for a trial of prime."

Great replacement for old black and white kindle So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.
great selection this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck

Great storage Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.

It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."

"Great Tablet I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader."

Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."

"Great value Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
"Great Value Great value, just the right size and weight. Suits my needs perfectly. Performs very well. Easy to get accessories to fit."
Great Value I purchased this for my husband as a replacement for his old one. He is very hay with it.
Great Value This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.
great value This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.
Great value and product Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant.
"Great value for the money. I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
"Great! Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly!"
Great! I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it!

Handy size tablet This tablet operates wonderfully. The size is handy. The graphics vibrant.For the affordable price it is unbeatable :-)
"Happy with this purchase I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product."
Heard good things about it Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it
High-quality inexpensive tablet I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.
Highly recommend The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
"I bought it for travel, but barely used it. It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
I brought it for my sister birthday She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much
"I like the size and the fact that it is compact. I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
"I love my Amazon Fire tablet I so love my Amazon fire tabletYou have.everything you want books, games etc. The picture are so clear and beautiful. I can't keep my son off of it . I'm thinking about getting another for him .He love watching videos of his favorite show"

I love the watch The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.
I love this Kindle This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.
I really enjoy this Kindle It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.
"I'm loving it I wish I could just say it is one of my best investment, I love the fact that now I don't have to drag around several of my favorite books I can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it I think it's great I should have gotten more memory though"

Internet connection shotty I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
intuitive Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
Is what it is Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
It is a good starter tablet. Bought it for my 8 yr old for Christmas and he loved it. I like that some of the apps that come with it can be deleted making more room for apps you would want to add.
It is perfect for a first tablet! I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
It was the I deal gift for my gran child It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
It works i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
It works great & fast. This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
It's a Kindle! Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
it's awesome i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.
"It's great I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner"
It's her second one! My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!
It's okay I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
"It's perfect!! Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words."
It's simple to use and my daughter loves it. I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
It's the 4th one I buy. This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
Its a gift Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
Just as advertised For a cheap starter tablet it's fine. Bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that.
Just what a 7 year old needs I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
Just what I was looking for Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation
"Keeps getting better I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account."
Keeps the grand kids busy Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games
KID FRIENDLY TABLET We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.
Kids friendly My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
Kids love it Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy
kindle It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it
"Kindle The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!"
Kindle 2nd I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
Kindle Fire Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
"Kindle FIRE Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
Kindle fire This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
"kindle fire 16 gig magenta I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome ."
Kindle Fire 7 Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
Kindle Fire great for reading Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
"kindle fire is great Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!"
"Kindle Fire is on Fire Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen."
"Kindle Fire, SWEET I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet!"
Kindle for grandchild I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
Kindle HD No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
Kindle just for books We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
Kindle love I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
Kindles rock I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.
"lAmazon Fire tablet - One of my Best Buy's Love this product, and don't know why it took so l"

"love it works great battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint."
love it! fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
Love it! I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.
"Love it! This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps."
"Love it!!! I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone ."

love my kindle bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!
Love my Kindle Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
Love my Kindle I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
Love my kindle Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas
Love my kindle Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
Love my kindles Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
Love my kindles!!! This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
Love my new Fire Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
Love the Amazon Fire Tablet The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.
Love the convenience in the palm of your hand Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
"Love the ease of use Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect."
Love the Fire Tablet!! I bought two of these for my 82 year old mother and 88 year old aunt - they love them! Easy to use! Great gift. Can't wait to buy one for me!
Love the Kindle. Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.
"Love the new tablet! I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it."
"Love this Fire! Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read."
Love this tablet Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.
Love this thing My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
love to read and get free books I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.
Loving It I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
Loving the pink look. I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.
Made a great gift Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
Made a great gift This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
Magic picture box This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
Mediocre This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
"More than an ebook reader. This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!"
Much slimmer profile best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
My 8 year old daughter loves it My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
"My daughter loves her new Fire tablet. My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at."
"My daughter loves it! I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them."
"My first tablet This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point."
my grandson loves it I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
"My grandson loves it, This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards."
"My K FIre I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
My order My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
My readER and gamer Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
My Sister's gift I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
"My son is entertained Bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. He loves it. Couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."
My w My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
Neat tablet This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.
Needed to replace my broken KindleFire This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
"Nephew's Birthday Gift Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!"
nice got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
Nice No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
"Nice affordable tablet This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable"
Nice basic item Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
Nice entry-level tablet Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
"Nice for a beginner This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere."
Nice gadget My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
Nice gift idea This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
Nice improvement over previous models Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
Nice item. We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
Nice little tablet This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
"Nice product for the price We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
"Nice simple tablet Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced"
Nice size to travel with. Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
Nice tablet I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!
niece loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect
No good I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
Noce I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
"Not a huge fan Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
Not Horrible Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
Not like other android tablets This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
Not perfect but excellent Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
"Not the greatest for kids We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
"Not user Friendly Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
Not what I was expecting. I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
Ok for what you pay Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
ok tablet for a small child The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.
"Ok Tablet for the Price Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
Operating system. Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.
Perfect Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
Perfect It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
Perfect My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
"Perfect Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!"
"Perfect combination of a tablet and reader I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
"Perfect for Beginners... Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
"Perfect for kids This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
"Perfect for kids and prime members Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
Perfect for my 10 year old granddaughter birthday Perfect for my granddaughter birthday. She loves to read. So many books
Perfect for my first tablet Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...
Perfect for my kids My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
Perfect for my son! So happy with the color choices! This will be perfect for my 10 year old and I am thrilled with thr price!
"Perfect for my uses and can't beat the price I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it."
"Perfect for non-tech-savvy parents. Purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. Perfect size. The front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added FB, sharing photos was easy. Amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of Kindle books. There are Amazon ads on the Kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device."
"Perfect Grad Gift This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
"Perfect Kids Tablet Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy."
"PERFECT SIZE PERFECT SIZE FOR TRAVELING, COMPACT AND LIGHT, AMAZON APPS ARE INCLUDED, GREAT FOR STREAMING VIDEOS AND SHOWS ON THE GO!!!!"
perfect size we had an older model from 2012 and it broke so we just replaced with newer one. Love the new features.
"perfect stream device Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase."
"Piece of junk Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
Pretty good but slow internet I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
"purchased for outdoor living space Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
Purchased to read books and web browsing Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
"Quite happy! So far, so good. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn't anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable."
"Really good tablet I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
really nice works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
"Returned Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
satisified nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
Serves the purpose I only bought this as a travel companion when I fly. It was cheap and functional.
short battery life The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!
"Should have bought one long ago! I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!"
Simple tablet Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
"Simply Awesome. Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device."
"Slow, Not enough apps, Tumblr Doesn't work Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
Small tablet This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
So far so good I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
So improved My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
Solid tablet I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues
Stay away Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
Still learning product. Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.
Suits me fine Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
Tablet Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
Tablet I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
Tablet It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
"Tablet Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven't put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!!"
Tablet does everything it's supposed to do I gave it away. It was too nice for me. The person I gave it to was gleeful.
tablet for my grandchild my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
Tablet for my son I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
"Tablet will not charge The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
"Tablet worked as it should, but... I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
Terrible Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
"The Amazon Fire is a great reading instrument. I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
The size is great for taking on the road The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
The tablet I bought was a 3th birthday gift.. Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....
The wife loves her new fire tablet Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.
"They love it Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one."
Third Kindle This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
This is a great tablet for the price This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.
"This is my 5th Kindle So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books."
This unit worked great This Fire worked great but I returned it because it was not the one I wantedBest Buy took it back for a full refund with no problems Best Buy is alsome
this was an upgrade Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
Thought id try I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
"Thought it was perfect for my 7!yr old It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate"
Too small Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
Top rated - Amazon Fire 7 tablet You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!
"Unbelievable Value The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
"Used daily I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music."
user friendly Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.
User Friendly I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.
Value for money My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
"Value for money With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
Very durable! This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.
Very easy to use I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
Very efficient I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
"Very Good The best product name on the market,no doubt about it."
Very good for the money I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
Very good price for the quality of the product Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
Very good tablet I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
"Very good tablet for basic use Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games."
Very good. It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.
very handy device Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
Very happy with it. I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
very happy with new Kindle Fire This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
"Very nice simple tablet Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent."
"Very satisfied with the price and ease of use. There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app."
"Very sturdy for a 5 year old I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
"Very versatile I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
visuals I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
We love the books that you can read. My daughter loves it. She loves the books that she can read.
"Who needs a laptop? I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod"
Wife likes it. Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.
Wife likes it. Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
Wife loved it I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
Wish it had more I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
"Wonderful I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!"
Wonderful colors I love the touch screen aspect still love the original.
"Wonderful tablet at a price that can't be beat (accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one."
Works as advertised Brother in law loves it. He's not very technical so perfect for him.
Works as described My second one and works better than the first one.
"Works great It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
Works great Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
"Works great for what I need for nursing class This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet."
"Works Well Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!"
world The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
"Worst product I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
worth the $ Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
Worth the money. Very fun for the kids My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
Yes Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
1st time user Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.
"2nd purchase First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
A book readers best friend I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
"a decent cheap tablet and e-reader This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself."
"A good cheap tablet. I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
"A good product and easy for a kid to handle. This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
A good tablet for this price.. I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.
"A great 7 inch tablet at a great price This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations."
A GREAT product for the price. I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.
A great tablet at a fabulous price I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
a simple machine this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
All around great!! Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
All I needed. Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.
"All in One Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements."
Alot of changes since my 1st Kindle fire I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
"Alright to do amazon or play games, watch videos I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep."
Always a great tablet. I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
Always in the go It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
Amazon Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games
Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet 16gb Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
Amazon Fire Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
Amazon Fire I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.

"Amazon Fire - Great 7"" Tablet Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size."
"Amazon Fire 16gb - I love this little tablet. This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy."
"amazon fire 7 Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
Amazon Fire 7 I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She reads books and plays games.
Amazon fire 7 This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
"Amazon fire 7 for kids This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
amazon fire 7 inch tablet amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.
"Amazon Fire 7 tablet 16gb Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
"Amazon Fire 7! This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device."

Amazon Fire Tablet This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.
Amazon is on Fire The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet I love my new Fire tablet. Nice backlight helps me to read my E-book in bed. Background color can be changed. I especially like the black background with white lettering; less glare on my eyes while reading.
An ok tablet It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
Another Table Replacement! Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.
Another winner. Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs.
"Appears good but should come with instruction book I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
Apps Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device
As expected I purchased I purchased for reading. It has been everything I have expected.
As good as other tablets Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.
Awesome I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!
Awesome The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it
awesome for games and movies Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.
awesome for grandma Bought this for my mom who is in her 70's. It's perfect and easy to use for the older generation.
Awesome for new tablet user. I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!
"Awesome tablet for the price Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
Awsome So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
bang for the buck for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
Bang for the buck limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works
Basic tablet. Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.
Basic tablet/reader Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
Basically a big phone...without the phone This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.
"Beats carrying multiple books After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
Beautiful item very good tablet .i like it. but regulation is little low.
"Best 7"" Kindle ever I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!"
Best dishwasher I've ever owned! I'm very tough on dishwashers and this one seems to be up to the challenge! I will never own another brand!
Best ever for my 4year old grandson My 4 Year old grandson likes to play games and watch movies. This was the best ever purchase I've done.
Best gift for the wife ever. My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
"Best tablet for our needs My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
"Best Tablet for tweens This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends."
Best tablet on the market for the money I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
Better every generation Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
"Better than before! The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!"
Better then I expected. I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.
"Big screen and clear resolution It's a nice upgrade from the 6"" screen. Size is just right for small kids hands. Reading kindle books is much easier."
Blockbuster Watch it over & over again!!! Blu ray is the best!
Book reader This is a great devise for reading books or taking photos. Best Buy Associate was very helpful.
bought for daughter in law and she likes it bought for daughter in law and she likes it. she wanted a fire
"Bought for my 24 year old daughter, she LOVES it!! It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her."
Bought for wife Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
Bought Kindle for my son He and his wife are delighted with it and the acess to the huge number of books available.
"Came in for a charger, bought a new phone - G7 Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer."
Carry everywhere Love this kindle excellent price I just carry it everywhere. Fits perfectly in my purse.
Charging Port Does Not Last - Not good for kids! I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
"Cheap This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
"Cheap but functional device Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices."
"cheap, easy, slow Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides."
Christmas Gift I bought it for my fianc and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
Christmas Gift I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
Christmas Gift I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
"Christmas Gift for Mom This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
Confused The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
"Confusing for me; returning I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
"Cost to benefit ratio great My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
Crashed after update My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
Daughter loves it My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.
"Daughter loves this gift tablet! 23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her."
Decent Tablet This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
Decent tablet for the money I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
DER Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.
Did not read reviews. My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
"didn't keep long but downgraded This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
Disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
"Disappointed Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
"Does a lot This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
Does exactly what I needed it for Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.
"Does it's job Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
Does the job My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
Does what I purchased it for. Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.
Does what I want A good product that provides the services I desire.
Dropbox Problem I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
Durable Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
Dwight Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
East to use I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
Easy access to my magazines and books. Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
"Easy enough for Grandpa Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
"Easy Replacement This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"
Easy Setup Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
Easy start up All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.
Easy to access and set up. Love its simplicity. Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.
"Easy to hold and use. Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use."
Easy to hold. Fast loading. Beautiful design. I lo This tablet is light weight and thin which makes it ideal to hold on my hands. I love it!
Easy to navigate! I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to download all of her games and apps that she uses to have on the iPad.
"Easy to read with Fire The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process."
"Easy to use Bought it for my mom, it was real easy to transfer her downloads from her phone to the tablet.."
Easy to use Easy to set up. East tie you. Would highly recommend this product to others
Easy to use Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too
Easy to use I am happy to have udated my fire! I love having the camera work the way it should. WAy to use.
Easy to use I love it. It is so easy to use and great apps to.
Easy to use I wanted something simple for my Mom to use and this is perfect for her.
Easy to use It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product
"easy to use purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!"
"Easy to use The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price."
Easy to use This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.
Easy to use Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.
"Easy to use, love it I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use."

Entertainment! Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.
"EXCELLENT Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
Excellent Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
EXCELLENT This tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on.
Excellent Book Reader Easy access to book reader. Love watching my Netflix.Con - Slow getting on Internet.
"Excellent choice! Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast."
"Excellent for Amazon product users and shoppers. Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
Excellent for children Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.
Excellent for Monitoring the kids!! I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
Excellent for reading books. I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.
Excellent for the cost. I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
"Excellent for those entering the tablet world. This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
excellent item It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use
"Excellent low cost tablet This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version"
Excellent Product I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
Excellent Product Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
Excellent product Tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet
"Excellent product for the money. It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
Excellent Product For The Price Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
Excellent Product For The Price Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
Excellent product for the price I needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips. Bought two of these and boy do they deliver!!! The best tablets for this price. The kindle book reader is an added bonus. The finishing is good. My kids love it.
"Excellent small tablet and outstanding e-reader! This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!"

excellent tablet Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
Excellent tablet Christmas gift for my niece Very pleased with the quality of this tablet and I was fortunate that it was on sale at the time of purchase
Excellent tablet for the money You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
Excellent tablet forever I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good
"Excellent tablet/reader for travel I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet."
Family Tablet We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
Fantastic Tablet Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
Fantastic tablet for reading This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.
Fantastic tablet for simplicity Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!
Fantastic tablet! I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
Fantastic tablet! I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
Fine It's a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it's not what I was thought it's going to be I returned it back just be of this reason
"Fine for Books Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
Fine for what we need Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
Fire 7 Tablet It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
"fire is easy to use. convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
Fire tablet Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
Fire tablet Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
Fire Tablet I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.
Fire Tablet I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
Fire tablet It's great for kids for a cheap iPad alternative however need credit card and no way to prevent accidental purchases
Fire! Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!
Fits I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
Fits perfectly in my hand I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
For my grandson. He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
For my sister birthday This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.
For my son.... I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
Frees up parents phones Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
Fun Product! Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
Functional at a good deal. I'm normally an Apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the Amazon Fire is.
Gave as a gift the recipient of this tablet uses it often and loves it so much that I'm buying one for myself.
"Gearfit2 Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome"
Gets the job done Was looking for something small I could use to get on the Internet and check emails and this is prefect for that
Gift Bought as a gift but have not had any issues with products purchased from you
"gift I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader."
Gift for mom Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.
Gift For Son Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.
Gift Purchase Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew for his birthday. He had been asking for a tablet forever. I made his day! He loves his tablet. All he's does is watch you tube and play games
Glad I purchased this item I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it
good Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
good everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do...
Good Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
Good I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet
"Good and cheap Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy"
"good and low cost great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
Good as long as it is plugged in to outlet. Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
"good basic tablet Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life"
Good beginner tablet Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.
Good buy This item works great and fitst anywhere. I have no complaints...
Good cheap tablet Great tablet especially for the price it's not an iPad by any means but will run and play a lot of androids apps works off wifi and has a micro ad card reader
"Good Cheap Tablet Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
"Good deal good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for"
Good deal Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
Good Deal Liked the first one so much I bought one for the wife
GOOD DEAL Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
good deal and on sale too! Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
Good device Nice device I like to use it to read books online.
Good experience & customer service Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
"Good First Tablet I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK."
"Good For a Cheap Tablet Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
"Good for children I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
"good for emails and social media I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes."
"Good for first time kindle owner I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
Good for its money. Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
Good for kids It's a good device for children because they don't know any better
Good for kids We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
Good for kids to use Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
Good for my 11 year old son My son uses the device to help him do his homework
"Good for reading and simple homework. Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
"Good for reading book. Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small."
"Good for reading books. Ok for a lot of activity The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
Good for the beginner Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
"Good for the money For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
Good for the money While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
Good for the price Excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at Bestbuy
Good for the price I bought this to read books on. Excellent for that. Difficult to navigate otherwise
"Good for the price Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
Good for the price Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
"Good for the price Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."
Good fun The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.
Good inexpensive tablet Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.
Good laptop for the price It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
Good little tablet Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
"Good little tablet Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics"
Good one to play with The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
Good picture and sound quality Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.
good present for brother my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
Good price My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.
"Good price Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook"
Good price for this Kindle Bought this as a gift.. Good price and features for this Kindle
Good Product Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.
"Good product Bought this for my son, it's been through some stuff and still going strong"
Good product My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
Good product Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear
Good product Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
"good product works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
Good product for price Enjoy using this product. My granddaughter downloads multiplied games to play and can play them while traveling. Good size and can easily fit into small bag.
Good product my son loves it... My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.
"Good Reader I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
"Good Reader Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage."
"good stuff I am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price"
Good tablet Excellent little tablet for reading books when you're on the go.
Good tablet I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
"Good Tablet Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge."
Good tablet This is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games.
Good tablet This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.
"Good tablet for average use The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
Good tablet for everyday use Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.
"Good tablet for kids Good tablet for the price, and excellent for kids."
Good tablet for my 6 yr old. This tablet is perfect for my six year old's learning apps.
Good tablet for price Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
"good tablet for that price For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good"
Good tablet for the price This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.
Good tablet for the price range Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
good tablet to star is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
Good tablet to watch videos I got this tablet on a deal and has good quality of video you can watch.
"Good Tablet With Lots of Features This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account."
"Good tablet. I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
good tabllet for the money I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
"Good value For the price you can't beat this little tablet, it does an awesome job!"
good value I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top
"good value It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine"
"Good value Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
"Good, but can be better It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
"Got Grandsons? We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
Got this for my 3 year old Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!
"Gotta get yourself one of these! This is so awesome, I can check my email when I'm not at home, if the place I'm visiting has WIFI. It also plays games! A true multi-tasker!"
Great First got the fire stick so the tablet was a great addition.
Great Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.
Great Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.
"Great Great tool for kids, special when you don't need to $$$ to much."

Great This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun
"Great & Easy to Use. I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games."
Great 16GB Tablet For the Price This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.
Great 4 kids Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
"great affordable tablet I'm very pleased with my Kindle fire. I've used it more than I thought I would, as I primarily was getting it for reading, but wanted the internet access and ability to review and edit documents, too. In addition to reading more lately than I usually do, I'm also turning my Fire on instead of my desk top computer if I'm only going to use it a short time."
Great Alternative to Ipad I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
Great amazon fire I love this and it's great for kids got it for a early Christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it
"Great Amazon product Love my kindle it's the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating"
Great and simple to use for anyone. My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
"Great apps for kids I got it just for my son and he can get on and play games and watch videos no problem, the parental controls are amazing and keep him in his specific apps"
"Great basic tablet I bought this for my 7 year old, it has endured all that a 7 year old would and could give it."
Great beginner tablet Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
"Great beginner tablet. I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money."
"Great beginner tablet. I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price."
"Great Big Thank YOU, I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is ""Mom, you are the best"", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!"
great birthday gift I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
Great Bluetooth device for audible books I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.
"Great buddie I'm enjoying my amazon fire. I've been reading great books, checking my e-mail and shopping.I highly recommend this product..value great quality great.You won't be disappointed."
Great buy Bought for my children. Holds plenty of apps. Safe to use with parental controls. Pretty durable but definitely recommend buying a screensaver and case for it.
Great buy I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
Great buy My son uses his tablet on a daily basis. He makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps. I can also use it and put on parental protections.
"Great buy Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
Great camera GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
"Great camera Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy"
Great cheap tablet I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.
Great Cheap Tablet This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.
"Great Christmas gift! My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
great color screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
Great color Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
Great computer for gamer It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
"Great deal on a great basic tablet This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them."
"great device Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
great device for my needs I bought this to stream HD music via bluetooth to my stereo. Works great and for the price offered can't be beat.
"Great device for reading and playing games. Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
Great E reader This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.
"Great e-reader If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
Great e-reader tablet Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.
Great e-reader! Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!
"Great entry level tablet Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound."
"Great Entry Level Tablet This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
Great Find Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus.

Great Tablets I Bought Two Of The Amazon Fire Tablets For My 6 & 8 Year Old And I've Had No Problems With Them.

Great tablets for reading books Love this tablet have had several others but this brand works everytime..very happy with my purchase
"Great to Read a variety of books It has a clear screen, the books are easy to download, I like the other features as well."
"Great to use and handy Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great"
Great to watch movies I like to watch movies on it. But it doesn't see to connect correctly to WiFi.
Great TV for the price. Good size for space I had for the TV. The color is good.
"Great value Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."

great value This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.
"Great value for the money. I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
"Great! Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly!"
Great! I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it!

"Happy with this product Good reader, nice small tablet, charging cord is to short."

High-quality inexpensive tablet I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.
Highly recommend The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
"I bought it for travel, but barely used it. It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
I brought it for my sister birthday She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much
"I do not like this tablet. Period. I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
I enjoy all of the features I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.
"I like the size and the fact that it is compact. I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
"I love my Amazon Fire tablet I so love my Amazon fire tabletYou have.everything you want books, games etc. The picture are so clear and beautiful. I can't keep my son off of it . I'm thinking about getting another for him .He love watching videos of his favorite show"
I love my Kindle I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here

I love this Kindle This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.
I really enjoy this Kindle It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.
"I wish I started with this one! Thrilled with the ease of use, so easy to navigate! I wish I had started with a tablet like this, it would have saved me a lot of frustration."

Internet connection shotty I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
intuitive Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
Is what it is Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
It is a good starter tablet. Bought it for my 8 yr old for Christmas and he loved it. I like that some of the apps that come with it can be deleted making more room for apps you would want to add.
It is perfect for a first tablet! I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
It was the I deal gift for my gran child It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
It works i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
It works great & fast. This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
"It's a great deal! It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it."
It's a Kindle! Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
it's awesome i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.
"It's great I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner"
It's her second one! My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!
It's okay I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
"It's perfect!! Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words."
It's simple to use and my daughter loves it. I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
It's the 4th one I buy. This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
Its a gift Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
"Its gd if you like amazon Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on."
Just as advertised For a cheap starter tablet it's fine. Bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that.
Just what a 7 year old needs I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
Just what I was looking for Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation
"Keeps getting better I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account."
Keeps the grand kids busy Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games

Kindle Love this tablet! This is my second. Just couldn't beat the price!!
"Kindle The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!"
Kindle 2nd I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
Kindle Fire Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
"Kindle FIRE Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
Kindle fire This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
Kindle Fire This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable
"kindle fire 16 gig magenta I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome ."
Kindle Fire 7 Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
Kindle Fire great for reading Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
"kindle fire is great Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!"
"Kindle Fire is on Fire Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen."
"Kindle Fire, SWEET I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet!"
Kindle for grandchild I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
Kindle HD No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
Kindle hd7 Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor.
Kindle just for books We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
Kindle love I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
Kindle produces great products Any Kindle product I have purchased is easy to use
Kindle tablet This product does what it say it do. I really enjoy reading
Kindles rock I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.
Lags Performance Eventually It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
"lAmazon Fire tablet - One of my Best Buy's Love this product, and don't know why it took so l"
Lighter weight Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me.
like the kindle was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
"Loses WI Fi Constantly The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection."
Lots of Nice Features So far my Fire is working well. I did have difficulty setting it up initially and had to ask a Best Buy tech to help me out. Connecting with my wireless was the most difficult step. The print is easy to read and can be enlarged. It is nice to be able to access e-mail. I find that it is easier to use if placed in a book-style protective case. That makes it easier to hold while reading. Anyone should enjoy using the Fire!
Love it Great device. Travels well. Easy to navigate. Would recommend.
Love it I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great
"Love it I have had 4 kindles over the years , got to have one to read my books & relax"

Love It We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use
"Love it - and yes you can use with Nook books too! Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy."
Love it and can't live without it. User friendly. Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.
"love it works great battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint."
love it! fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
Love it! I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.
"Love it!!! I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone ."
Love it!!! This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to.
"Love it. Battery life is awesome I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them."
"Love my Fire I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my ""library"" that's not taking up space on my phone."
Love my Fire My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows
"Love my Fire! I debated on what tablet/reader to buy and decided on the fire! I have been very pleased with it. Bought it on sale, what a great price!"
love my kindle bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!
Love my Kindle Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
Love my Kindle I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
Love my kindle Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas
Love my kindle Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.
Love my kindle Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
Love my kindles Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
Love my kindles!!! This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
Love my new Fire Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
Love the Amazon Fire Tablet The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.
Love the convenience in the palm of your hand Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
"Love the ease of use Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect."
Love the Fire Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.
Love the Fire Tablet!! I bought two of these for my 82 year old mother and 88 year old aunt - they love them! Easy to use! Great gift. Can't wait to buy one for me!
Love the kindle! I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased.
Love the Kindle. Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.
"Love the new options available on my new Kindle I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!!"
"Love the new tablet! I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it."
"Love the response time I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store."
Love the versatility of this Fire This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements.
"Love this Fire! Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read."
Love this tablet Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.
Love this thing My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
love to read and get free books I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.
loved it was a great purchase. loved the color and the camera feature
Loving It I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
Loving the pink look. I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.

Made a great gift Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
Made a great gift This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
Magic picture box This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
Mediocre This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
More space needed. Had 8 GB. I bought Geek Squad for 2 years. Well after 13 months my device became broken. So the warranty came in handy. Thank you knowing things happend in life.
"More than an ebook reader. This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!"
Much slimmer profile best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
My 8 year old daughter loves it My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
"My daughter loves it! I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them."
"My first tablet This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point."
my grandson loves it I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
"My grandson loves it, This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards."
"My K FIre I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
My order My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
My readER and gamer Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
My Sister's gift I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
My son enjoys his tablet! This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.
"My son is entertained Bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. He loves it. Couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."
My son loves it! Perfect device for gaming apps and on-the-go streaming!
My Son loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great tablet. Perfect for my 8 year old son!!!!!!!!!!!
My w My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
"My wife's birthday present She loves it, she has one of the first Kindles and uses it daily, so this new one was a surprise and she enjoys the color in some of the cookbooks. The clarity and the Washington Post was an added feature, and fact that it was so easy to use."
Neat tablet This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.
Needed to replace my broken KindleFire This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
"Nephew's Birthday Gift Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!"
nice got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
Nice No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
Nice 7in tablet Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.
"Nice affordable tablet This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable"
Nice basic item Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
"Nice compact tablet I bought this for my wife, basically just for reading books. She has come to love it. She is constantly reading. Lighting wasn't an issue or I would have gotten the reader.When she isn't reading, I borrow it for puzzle type games, and it is great. Not a iPad by any stretch but it is more convenient than the mini that she also owns. Prior to the Amazon Fire she was reading on the iPhone 6+.a"
"Nice easy to use A friend loves hers & told me I would love it, I do"
Nice entry-level tablet Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
"Nice for a beginner This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere."
Nice gadget My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
Nice gift idea This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
Nice improvement over previous models Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
Nice item. We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
Nice little tablet This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
Nice phone system I love my new Panasonic phone system. It has 2 handsets which is a good idea for those living with family! I also like the ease of operating the answering machine as well. Thank you Best Buy!
"Nice product for the price We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
"Nice simple tablet Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced"
Nice size to travel with. Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
Nice Tablet for the money Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
Nice tablet simple and too many things to do. Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy.
nice to have nice to have to watch netflexs on in bed and relax.
Nice upgrade My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.
niece loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect
No good I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
Noce I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
"Not a huge fan Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
not as good as an ipad but gets the job done i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done
"Not as good as before Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better"
Not good Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again
Not Horrible Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
Not like other android tablets This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
"Not off to a great start. When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet."
Not perfect but excellent Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
"Not the greatest for kids We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
"Not user Friendly Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
Not what I need. I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
Not what I was expecting. I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
"OK For Entry Level Tablet My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."
"Ok for reading, not so much for browsing good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing."
Ok for the price. Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
Ok for what you pay Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
"Ok product Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok"
"Ok Tablet for the Price Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
"Okay Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available"
Okay tablet Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.

"Overall okay Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store."
Perfect Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
Perfect I love this tablet. It's the perfect size for my kid. Keeps him entertained during long trips. We picked up the free time kid proof case and it's perfect also.
Perfect It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
Perfect My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
"Perfect Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!"
Perfect Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
"Perfect combination of a tablet and reader I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
"Perfect for Beginners... Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
"Perfect for kids This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
"Perfect for kids and prime members Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
"Perfect for Mom I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs."
Perfect for my 10 year old granddaughter birthday Perfect for my granddaughter birthday. She loves to read. So many books
"Perfect for my daughter Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."
Perfect for my first tablet Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...
Perfect for my kids My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
"Perfect for my uses and can't beat the price I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it."
"Perfect for non-tech-savvy parents. Purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. Perfect size. The front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added FB, sharing photos was easy. Amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of Kindle books. There are Amazon ads on the Kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device."
Perfect for the Price! A great tablet for the price--really no major complaints!
Perfect for travel Does everything I need and has a long battery life.
"Perfect Grad Gift This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
"Perfect Kids Tablet Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy."
"PERFECT SIZE PERFECT SIZE FOR TRAVELING, COMPACT AND LIGHT, AMAZON APPS ARE INCLUDED, GREAT FOR STREAMING VIDEOS AND SHOWS ON THE GO!!!!"
Perfect size for my son I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.
"perfect stream device Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase."
"Piece of junk Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
Pretty good but slow internet I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
Pretty good for the price So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !
Product/Price value is awesome. The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price.
"purchased for outdoor living space Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
Purchased to read books and web browsing Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
"Quite happy! So far, so good. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn't anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable."
Reader Good product and the quality of the product is good. Easy to use.
Really good for reading and downloading apps I personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun
"Really good tablet I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
really nice works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
reliable This is my son's 4th kindle. It is reliable but the charging plug area wears out quickly
"Returned Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
"Satisfied, good buy Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially."
satisified nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
Second one purchased For 7 year old. Now has two in different colors - can tell what is on which one by color.
"Should have bought one long ago! I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!"
"Significantly improved This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker."
Simple tablet Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
Simple to use I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
"Simply Awesome. Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device."
"Slow, Not enough apps, Tumblr Doesn't work Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
"Slow! Don't waste you money! I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
Small tablet This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
So far so good I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
"So far, so good Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!"
So improved My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
"Solid product We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need."
Solid tablet I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues
"Soooo cool! I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!"
Stay away Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
Still learning product. Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.
Suits me fine Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
"surprising Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable"
Tablet Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
Tablet Had a kids fire and switched to this with a kids case and tempered glass this time works really well for kids
Tablet I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
Tablet It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
"Tablet Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven't put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!!"
"Tablet This is a first for an adult. Price is right, easy to use and just the right size."
Tablet does everything it's supposed to do I gave it away. It was too nice for me. The person I gave it to was gleeful.
tablet for my grandchild my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
Tablet for my son I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
"Tablet will not charge The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
"Tablet worked as it should, but... I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
Terrible Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
"The Amazon Fire is a great reading instrument. I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
"The best tablet for anything Amazon Great to view movies, play games, surf the net. Makes shopping on Amazon music easy"
The size is great for taking on the road The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
The wife loves her new fire tablet Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.
"They love it Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one."
Third Kindle This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
This is a great tablet for the price This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.
"This is my 5th Kindle So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books."
This item is not my primary tablet but is adequate This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.
this was an upgrade Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
Thought id try I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
"Thought it was perfect for my 7!yr old It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate"
Too small Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
Top rated - Amazon Fire 7 tablet You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!
"Unbelievable Value The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
"Unfortunate Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy."
"Used daily I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music."
user friendly Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.
User Friendly I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.
Uss it all the time Upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was 4 years old. So worth it.
Value for money My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
"Value for money With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
Very durable! This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.
Very easy to use I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
Very efficient I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
"Very Good The best product name on the market,no doubt about it."
Very good for the money I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
Very good Kindle for the price. Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
Very good price for the quality of the product Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
Very good tablet I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
"Very good tablet for basic use Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games."
Very good. It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.
very googd product is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks
very handy device Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
Very happy with it. I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
very happy with new Kindle Fire This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
"Very nice simple tablet Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent."
Very pleased. Gift was on point. Recipient was very pleased. Would recommend to others.
"Very satisfied with the price and ease of use. There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app."
"Very sturdy for a 5 year old I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
"Very versatile I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
visuals I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
We love the books that you can read. My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.
Well satisfied with the TV Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product
Wife likes it This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device
Wife likes it. Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.
Wife likes it. Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
Wife loved it I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
Wish it had more I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
"Wonderful I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!"
"wonderful I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it"
Wonderful colors I love the touch screen aspect still love the original.
"Wonderful tablet at a price that can't be beat (accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one."
Works as described My second one and works better than the first one.
"Works great It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
Works great Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
"Works great Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great."
"Works great for what I need for nursing class This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet."
"Works Well Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!"
Works well and fully functional Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.
Works well. Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.
world The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
"Worst Fire Tablet of all I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on."
"Worst product I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
worth the $ Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
Worth the money. Very fun for the kids My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
Yes Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
2 year old loves it great tablet for kids when traveling. my grandchild loves it.
"2yr old approved Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all."
"3 year old granddaughter loves it!!! Easy for her Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter."
9 year old loves My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever.
"A good starter but not for the impatient My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these ""kids"" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell."
"A good value This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
"A great little computer Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet.

An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,"
A great table for kids My son is 4 and he loves it. Super easy to use for kids.
A Kindle that's kid resistant A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. Great deal on a great product.
A nice gift for my grandaughter to learn her ABCs My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.
a perfect gift for our 5 year old granddaughter the tablet is just the right size for our granddaughter. she loves it. she can play her little games and has so much fun with it.
A real home run This is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.
A real value We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.
"A very good Tablet for kids I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."
Age Appropriate Interface My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.
Agreat gift for the grandkids The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
"Almost I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her."
Amazing My daughter loves this. There are so many settings and you don't have to buy every app individual. So many books and educational apps :)
Amazing My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it
"amazing and unique This tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end."
Amazing product This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend
"Amazon - Fire Kids Edition I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked."
Amazon - Fire Kids Edition This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.
Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 - Tablet - 16gb - G My granddaughter loves this tablet. She is two and has no problem playing the games and using this tablet. It's very user friendly and keeps her busy for hours.
Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is FIRE !!!! The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips
Amazon 7-inch fire kids tablet Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily
Amazon did great with this product Love the color pink for granddaughter she loves carrying around her own tablet. Wonderful product. love the safety protective case great unit.
Amazon Fire Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.
amazon fire this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover
"Amazon Fire kids edition 7 Tablet 16 gb We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this"
"Amazon kid version Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend."
"AMAZON KID's FIRE TABLETS I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend."
Amazon tablet Purchased for my niece and she loves it. I like the fact I can set limits on her tablet and restrict her access until she has read. Only downside is the case doesn't have a kickstand so that the tablet can be placed upright for viewing videos/movies. But a new case can be purchased.
Amazon tablet The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke
"Amazon- Fire, grandsons edition Excellent product. My grandson loves it. Fast, easy to use and yet challenging enough that he is learning at the same time"
"An OK tablet This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80"
"Autism, Speech Delays, and Fire Kids Edition I didn't know how well he would do with a full blown tablet, but I am shocked at how well he navigates it ON HIS OWN. He does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. His letter understanding (he's 3.5) has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. Plus, it's a great motivation tool. I love it, and he does, too."
"Awesome Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it"
Awesome Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!
Awesome Great Christmas gift for my son. Best tablet ever.
"Awesome Great for kids, bought both colors for two of my kids."

Awesome Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning
Awesome Great tablet with good parental controls for kids!!
Awesome Have had other products similar for the kids but this is the best by far. Best Buy had a great price too so decided to try it. Love it.
Awesome My 4 year old loves it. I love that she can use it unsupervised without worry. She has been learning her alphabet and this has been a great tool.
Awesome My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!
Awesome My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.

Awesome My son is a huge fan of it and I love that I can control what he watches and plays
Awesome This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.
Awesome camera This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it
"Awesome device for a young child I bought the first kindle years ago for my sister. When my oldest turned 1, he wouldn't leave her kindle alone. We decided to buy him one & he has had it ever since. The learning apps such as the counting ones, ones about learning shapes, and learning his ABCs, assists in his advancement in his schooling. We all have a kindle in the house, to include my 3 year old (this is his first year with one). Love it!"
"Awesome for kids This is the perfect tablet for a toddler. I feel like there is stuff for him to now, but he can also grow with it. And it's built like a tank."
"Awesome for rough kids My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!"
Awesome for the kids Very awesome tablet for kids and great parental controls
Awesome for toddlers Bought it for my granddaughter. She is so smart. She can get on and find her apps. She lives the videos and games.

"Awesome kids tablet Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
Awesome kids tablet This is an excellent tool to help our granddaughter advance her learning skills and also allows her an opportunity to play educational games
"awesome kindle I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that's all that matters."
Awesome product! My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down!
"AWESOME SAUCE This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi."
Awesome tablet This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
"Awesome tablet for a 5 year old!!!! I especially loved the bumper that protects it! He absolutely loved this gift! It has parental control. It has the ability to buy games that are educational for him; and we are all thrilled with it....myself, his parents and our little guy!!!!"
Awesome tablet for a child! Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!
Awesome tablet for kids I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.
Awesome Tablet for Kids This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops.
Awesome tablet for my 2 yr old grandson This is a great tablet. My grandson uses it to watch his cartoons. We also have ABC Mouse that he uses on it. It's very durable and he loves it!!
Awesome tablet for my young daughter. Love the amount of time we can set that she can be on this! The bumper guard has been handy. Apps that were on it are awesome. Best of all she loves it!
"Awesome tablet for young children I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone."
"Awesome tablet for younger kids under 10 Love this tablet, great value, come with great protective case, preloaded apps are an awesome feature. The included 2 year protection is also a plus."
awesome tablet. My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...
Awesome warranty! Arrived yesterday as promised! Little one loves it
Awesome! Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.
Awesome! My 3 yr old loves her new tablet and my wife and I are glad to get ours back. Very simple usage. Has all of her favorite apps on it.
Awesome! My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She
Awesome! This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
"Awesome!!! I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work."
Awesomely safe & Educational It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids
Baby loved it My son loves his tablet. It is very easy to use. Very stutdy.
"Bad plug The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
"Bad product Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services."
Battery sucks Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.
"Be aware these require a credit card I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
Beautiful design Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it
"Beginner tablet it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
best child's tablet This is the best child's tablet and some adults like me can benefit from the warranty and matched case
best for the younger kids Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we!
"Best gift I ever purchased for my grandchildren! Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!"
"Best Kindle for my needs* This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
Best possible choice I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.
Best purchase ever I bought this for my grandson and it hasn't disappointed me at all! He loves his tablet! I am looking at buying his sister one next!
"Best purchase for 4 yr old purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it."
Best Tab for kids This is one of the best tabs for kids to start with.Rugged and sophisticated.
Best Tablet This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
Best Tablet EVER!!! Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
"Best tablet ever!!! My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome"
Best tablet for kids Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
Best tablet for kids I bought this and onother one in blue. The kids love it.
Best tablet for kids The best tablet for kids the 1 year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it..
Best tablet for kids. This is the second one I bought. My older son wouldn't share his so for Christmas santa brought little brother one lol. The apps that come with the subscription are endless. I also have Netflix and both kids watch different shows on it too. I once bought a sprout cubby tablet and it broke within 2 days and the customer service was terrible they would not replace and actually wanted to charge more than I paid. The customer service with amazon however is fantastic and replaced my sons tablet when it cracked within 3 days!! They are durable but my older toddler is Just a crazy lil man. You won't regret buying this for your kids.
Best Tablet for Toddlers Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.
Best tablet for young children Son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. Nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. No questions asked.
Best Tablet out there for a toddler Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.
"Best tablet out there for kids!! I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!"
"Better and Better Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use."
better than a nabi 2 my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.
Birthday gift Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
Birthday gift Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
"bloaaattted WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
bloated Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
Bought for grandsons This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
"Bought for my grandchildren Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
bought for my grandson and he loves it. I got this because it is almost impossible to break
Bought it for grandson and he loves it Bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn't broken it either.
Boy tablet I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
Charging cord It would have been nice if the charging cord was more compatible with other devices.
Charging plug The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
"Charging Ports I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
"Child friendly! Great gift, for my kid's second birthday! This product is very child friendly and easy to use! I recommend this product for families!"
Child Kindle Review My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
childrens kindle great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
ChildsPlay This is the way to go for an all-in-one package for the kids. Everything is set-up and easily controlled through adult log in...
"Christmas Gift This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy."
"christmas present This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it."
"Chronic issue with charging port The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
Could be a great tablet The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.
Cute Great price for product. It's get of you have kids.
"Cute, but not user friendly nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate"
"Daughter love it! My daughter is learning so much from the games on this device, my wife was glad I bought it."
"Daughter Loves It! My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
Decent My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained
Decent game so far I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
"Decent Kids Edition This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
Decent tablet for kids Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
"Decent tablet for younger kids I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
"Decent, does the job Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good."
Device is not as rugged as it could be returning returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
Did not work properly. It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
"Didn't like it Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it"
"Disappointed doesn't play Netflix So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
"Disappointing product. Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!"
Do not recommend for 1yr old. My Mistake to buy for 1yr old.But my 30yr old son enjoys it!
"Does what it says, missing one key feature There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated."
"Don't like...too hard to download other apps I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
durable Great to give to the little ones so they don't break my phone. Found it at a great price and used rewards to bring the price down more.
Durable Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
Durable This is my 2yr. olds and he loves it. He loves the different games and watching reviews.
Durable and easy to navigate This is very durable for a young child. It is very easy to use even for my 2 yo granddaughter.
durable and fun tablet for kids I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.
Durable tablet This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
E Tablet Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it .
Early morning helper We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.
ease of use Bought for grand daughter for Xmas since most 5 year olds now a lot about tablets and had no problem with this very easy to use.
Easiest Solution Best tablet for my 2 year old son... it has helped a lot and seems to be the most simple kids tablet system available
easy I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!
EASY FOR KIDS BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.
Easy for kids granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.
"Easy for my grand daughter to use I bought this for several reasons, the 2 year warranty, ease of use. My granddaughter is 21 months old and she has figured it out. Very durable, she drops it and it keeps on working"
Easy setup My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.
Easy setup This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
"Easy to get up and going This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase."
easy to teach my 3 year old to use it Easy and age appropriate. Can set timers for tv and movie watching my granddaughter finds the educational games more interesting and fun.
Easy to use Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. She is able to easily use it with minimum assistance.
Easy to use Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life.
"Easy to use Easy to use. Great for kids. Great for mom when kids steal mom's phone. Lightweight. Great protective case. But it gets really dirty, real quick."
Easy to use Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
Easy to use Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.
Easy to use This was purchased for my grandson. It has been easy for him to use. Love the parental controls and free time mode. The included bumper case is a bonus.
"Easy to use and sturdy to boot! My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"Easy to use for my 9 yr old My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection."
"Easy to use for our seven year old Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."

"Excelent idea, $$$ & content. UI needs improvement The idea is great, a kindle just for kids. Design just for them with pre-approved content.The price was great. I got it for $79.99 on black friday. Plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. They break it, we fix it. Is that simple.Content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.User Interface, not the best one. Amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content."

"Excellent for kids Got 2 of these for my two oldest daughters, 5 and 3. Perfect for them and love the features. Battery life seems pretty long. The year of freetime plus the case makes it worth it! Will be getting another for my 3rd daughter's 2nd birthday."
Excellent for kids This is a great tablet for children and really has an easy to use format. The apps work well and keep the kid entertained by not distracting them with the mechanics.

Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also."

Excellent my grandson loves it! My Grandson uses it all the time. It was a great choice!
"Excellent parental settings You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile.

Excellent price My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present
Excellent price My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.
"Excellent Product This is an excellent product for kids. There are lots of games, books (including interactive ones) and cartoons. I also like you can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. The only downfall is the charger cable sucks."

Excellent Tablet for Kids My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode.

"Fantastic!! My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."
Fire Away! This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
Fire kids edition I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
Fire Kids table My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
"Fire Kids Tablet The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far."
For beginner It's good for toddlers. Would recommend to another parent.

For my 3 year old son I did some looking in the web and after looking at many tablets this was the best choice.
For my Grandchild Did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value.
For my granddaughter She loves to be on the tablet all the time . So now she will have her own.
Fun My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained
Fun for kids It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
Fun for kids My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone !

Good babysitter for my 19 month old It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.
Good bargain My 5 year old grandson really enjoys his new tablet. He's had it for several months. The only negative I see is the charge port is starting to get loose. The small plug is maybe not robust enough for a 5 year old.
Good beginner tablet Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.
"Good but SLOW A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
Good buy I bought it for my 2 (almost 3) year old. He really lover it. I love that I can put a timer on it and he can't be on it all day. It's easy to use. The only thing I hate is how fast the battery runs down even if not in use.
Good Buy for Kids Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature
Good child tablet Excellent quality and durability for a young child
"Good educational device with parental controls When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Installed a 64 gb micro SD and install as many apps to the card as possible to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 5 year old granddaughter."
Good entertainment for Kids My little girl loves this tablet. It keeps her engaged and entertained. It comes with a protective case that protects it from falls and the handlings' of kids. You can download apps and with parental control you are protected from your kids accidentally making unnecessary purchases without your knowledge. Great tablet for kids!
Good first tablet for kids It's a good tablet for a young kid. A little hard to navigate even for adults. Cant figure out how to navigate the internet!
Good for 4 year old This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.
Good for 5 &up I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire
Good for beginning users. This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.
"Good for convenience Good for convenience when other devices are tied up, but the keyboard lags a little slower than I would like."
good for games This is a kid friendly tablet good for gaming and learning games as well. Glad we got it.
Good for grandchild Setup was extremely easy. Easy for grandchild to use. Only difficulty is with parental controls stopping connection with library.
Good for grandson He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics

Good for kids Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
"good for kids my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
Good for kids My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.
"good for kids This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
Good for Kids We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
Good for kids 6 to 10 Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it
Good for kids ages 6 to 10 I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded
"Good for kids but SLOW A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
Good for kids under 10y My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.
Good for kids. My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one.
Good for little fingers My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.

Good for nights out Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.
Good for preschoolers Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better
Good for small children It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
Good for small kids Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
"Good for the price We had given hand-me down iPhones to the kids to use for car trips and the like a while back and were looking to update them. For the price, this is the best deal. You have access to a lot of the same apps (although you might have to start them over). It has a durable case. And is a good size for little hands. It is very helpful to be able to time activities so they don't have a choice about handing it back over. Only downside is one of our cords doesn't charge as well as we'd like and sometimes it seems a little slow starting certain apps in comparison to our apple products. But if you don't want to pay the apple price, this is the way to go. Kids will definitely be entertained by it!"
"Good For the Price / Play games and Watch Movies My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!"
Good for toddlers Good for toddlersEasy to carryEasy to download
Good for young kids Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast
Good for younger children A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
Good for younger kids My son just loves it and he thinks it's easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it
good games For two girls that love to play games and take with them
Good Gift for Kids for Holiday Season Bought for my kid - 5 year old Kid. Worth a buy. Recommended.
Good Gift! I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.
Good idea Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.
Good inexpensive Tablet Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.
Good item for my granddaughters This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier
Good kids kindle But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.
Good kids tablet Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
"Good kids tablet Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps."

"Good product but hard to setup for Grandson This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
Good product for toddler I enjoy the product. It was easy to program. My toddler pushed a button that changed the setting. I took the product to the store and the kind salesman corrected the product.
Good product for young child. My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal.
Good purchase Bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. Wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase.
Good size I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps
"good starter tablet I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it"
Good stuff My daughter loves it and so does my son and wife too.

So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints."
"Good tablet for kids!! My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!"
Good tablet for kids. My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!
Good tablet for kids. Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.
Good tablet for toddlers This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.
Good Tablet for Toddlers to Teen Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..
Good tablets for beginners. My kids have really enjoyed this tablet. This makes car rides a lot easier. They both can create and learn and they love the camera.
"Good Value We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
Good warranty and protection Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
"Good working tablet This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."

Grandkids love them We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow.

Great This is the second kindle my daughter has been using and its been good.
Great Very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it
Great We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.
"Great Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too"
great 2 year warranty interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.
Great apps for beginners A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids
Great bargain Price was just right.i would recommend to someone.
"Great battery life, very kid friendly Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features."
Great beginner for younger children Purchased these for our grandchildren ... great for children learning to use electronics.
Great beginner tablet My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I'd highly recommend this product
Great beginner tablet This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.
"great beginners kids tablet The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"
Great bumper The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
"Great but aggravating at times My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
"Great Buy Bought this for my 3 kids aged 9,7,and 2. They all use it with ease. They each have their own account with appropriate games. We like the protective cover that absorbs drops and falls well."
Great buy Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.
"Great Buy Great tablets, prefer over the Nabi anyday. Love the color choices"
"Great Buy I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I love that it has so much memory space, so I can download tons of games and activities to keep him occupied on long rides. I love the 2 year warranty and safety case. He loves it!"
"great buy My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music."
"Great buy This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly."
Great buy for the price Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. Great buy for the price. He loves his new tablet.

great childs tablet my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps.
"Great choice for kids! We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice!

"Great device for my grandchildren Bought 3 for my young grandkids exceptional security for kids, great babysitter as well as educational tool"
"Great device for my grandchildren I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase."
Great device for our grandson. This device provides necessary app and is extremely user friendly.
"Great Device! We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. The kids love it and it is simple to use. The ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. We can switch to our profile to watch Netflix or use other apps if we want. Comes with a great warranty and device protector. We're very happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet."
Great display Really great item for the kids and very user friendly
Great educational tool My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy
"Great Fire Tablet We purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play games and read books without having to use her mom's devices. She took to it immediately. It connects easily to a 2.4 ghz network but does not support connectivity to a 5; search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it was the Fire or the network, then again, it was running updates. The camera takes great pictures even if a child is a bit shakey... Sound quality is very good as is touch sensitivity."
"Great first tab My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his"
"Great first tablet Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks"
Great first tablet for kids! My granddaughter LOVES it! LOTS of kid-friendly apps for a 5 year old!
Great fit for my 2 year old Everything he needs but nothing more. The case looked a little flimsy but it has been great so far.
Great for 3 year old granddaughter Easy for 3 year old to navigate. Like the adult to kid use.
"Great for 5 Year Old Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day."
"Great for 5 year olds This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time."
"Great for 7 year old Santa brought this to our daughter, she's 7 and it's perfect for her!! Easy to use and figure out!"
"Great for a 2 year old I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that."
"Great for a 3 year old. Great tablet for a little kid. I was debating between this and an ipad but figured an ipad would be way too much for a tablet. Its nice because you can switch users. If you want something simple , then this is the one for you."
"Great for a 4 year old! I got this for ky 3 year old and she loves it. She has dropped it a fews times, once outside and it just bounced. I also love that I can set restrictions on play time, I can have it where this is no play time until a certain number of minutes of reading time has been completed. I don't have set times of the day that she can even get on it"
"Great for a 4 year old! Very easy for my child to navigate. It was very easy to set it up. All the games, books and internet that's pre-loaded is awesome and so convenient"
"Great for a 4 yearold Love the parental controls and more storage than previous models, but still seems to run out."
Great for a child My eight year old loves the games and it is safe for her to use.
Great for a kid Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
Great for a kid Perfect for price and purpose. I bought this for my 19 month old granddaughter to watch videos and listen to songs on instead of using parents iPhone. When she is older she will be able to play games. Perfect size for her to hold. Love guarantee

"Great for a toddler Easy to use, handle and screen is perfect for a toddler."
Great for a toddler Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
Great for a young child Very durable and easy to use. Last for several years with all that it can do.
"Great for all ages Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year."
"Great for all ages Thought this would be too advanced for my 3 year old, but she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and learn patience. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept her honest."
"Great for all ages Thought this would be too bland for an 8 year old, but he loves it. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept him honest."

Great for Children. As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact.

"Great for kids! My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"
Great for kids! My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!
"Great for kids! My son is constantly distracted and loves technology. Him being only two years old, this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble."
"Great for kids! Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now."
Great for Kids! This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.
"Great for kids!! lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!"
Great for kids!!! I have a four year old daughter who has learned a lot from using this tablet. The child feature is great because she can access everything for her age in one area ( with parental settings of course). I really love this tablet

"great for little kids this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids."

"Great for my 5 year old! This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"
Great for my 6 year old. I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.
Great for my daughter My daughter who is two loves it. She colors and dose puzzles

Great for my kids My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.
Great for my toddler I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long

Great for our 3 year old This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!
"Great for our almost two year old We are super happy with the kindle fire. We had bought several DVD players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. Now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read. It also doubles as a tablet for me since it gives the options for different profiles. We love it!"
"great for pre school children My 4 year old loves it. Easy to function and pretty tough, it has been dropped a few times and did not crack or break."
"Great for pre-school and elementary Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better."
Great for road trips! As long as apps are downloaded before leaving WIFI they work great for road trips or hunting trips!

Great for the kids! purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"Great for the kids... no Google Play Store These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
"Great for the price and the kids Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week."

Great gift for My Granddaughter I hope that Azi will like to have her own entertainment instead of playing games on the cell phone.
Great gift for the little ones I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.
Great gift for young children I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.

Great Kids tablet I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7yr old granddaughter and it's very easy for her to use.
"Great kids tablet I bought this tablet for my 5-year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. It's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games."
Great kids tablet I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
"Great kids tablet I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"

Great Kids Tablet It is a great starter tablet for young kids. My son really enjoyed it.
great kids tablet love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
"Great kids tablet my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price"

Great kids tablet Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.
Great kids tablet This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.
"Great kids tablet This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
Great kids tablet This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
Great kids tablet..hours of fun and education I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer.
Great kindle Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it
Great kindle fire for kids I like the fact that there is parental control plus by putting your child's age the kindle will only send you games that are designed for your child's age
Great kindle for kids My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!
Great kindle for kids This is a great kindle for kids to use as it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down.
Great learning and developmental tool. I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing 1 for another grandchild in October. They love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them.
Great Learning Apps Awesome for kidsIt's educationalI love the blue cover!!!
Great learning tablet for children I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
"Great light wight Easy to use, love the color and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up very happy with my purchase."
Great little gadget I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.
"Great little tablet Bought this for my 4yo daughter for Christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. It survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the USB power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. However this is where Amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for Amazon to replace if damaged. I called customer service, they took my info and I had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!"
Great Little Tablet Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities.
"Great little tablet I purchased this for my youngest grandson, age 4 for christmas and he will be receiving it shortly. Games have been downloaded and it will be charged and ready to use when he opens his gift."
"Great little tablet This was purchased for my older grandson, age 6, for Christmas and as I stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him."
Great little unit for young girl Great unit my neice can use when traveling to watch videos and take photos.
Great micro card I love this this memory card. The price was good ty
Great old time games Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer
Great option for child This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
Great Pad for a child My grandson used my old I Phone to play on. Got him this tablet and he loves it! Great deal!
Great price but beware - not all apps work I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
"Great price! I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!"
Great product Bought this item for my 1 yr old and at first would not pay attention to it since he loves to run around. But when we are out its a good tablet for a kid and very durable since kids tend to drop toys. We use it to watch movies and even kid educational apps. It's a good buy for the price and to entertain the kids. Video quality is very good.
Great product Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features
Great product Easy for kids to use. Keeps them entertained for hours. Love it!
Great product Exactly what I needed for my hand daughter. She loves it and leaves mine alone.
Great product Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price
"Great Product Got this for my 7 year old daughter, she loves it. We read on it, she plays on it, there are videos on it, and she can't or hasn't found a way to break it yet. Well done Amazon, well done."
Great product Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.
Great product Great product easy to set up and use my child loves it
Great Product I bought 1 a year ago for our oldest kid. Came back this year and bought two more. Built really well. This is the best choice for a kids tablet.
"Great product I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. Her only disappointment is that she is unable to access the ""Musicality"" app."
Great Product It was the best Christmas Present for my grandson.
great product Keeps the kids busy with games and activities and they really like it
Great product Kids love playing with it. We use it for netflix and for basic games
Great product Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!!
Great Product My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!
Great product My daughter is going to love this for christmas!!! Thanks best buy.
"Great product My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."

Great product and service Great product and great service from bestbuy online
"Great product at a great price Purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since I notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing."
Great product for a child My 4 year old daughter loves her fire for kids. Keeps her very entertained at all times
Great product for child The only complaint is that you get a year free of Amazon free time but after that first year you start getting charged till you cancel.
Great product for kids eady enough for my 3 year old to use by herself. Can turn it on and choose her app. Comes with s protective case. Great product for kids to learn on.
great product for kids got this product for my granddaughter. im #1 grandma now
Great product for kids This is for my 5 year old and she hasn't put it down since Christmas. She uses it for watching videos and taking pictures of her toys..
Great product for kids! User friendly The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.
Great product for kids. This tablet is great for kids. I bought it for my Grandson and he is delighted with it. He uses it constantly.
Great product for the price. Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse.
"Great product, USB connection could be better This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there."
"Great product! My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use."
Great product! Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.
Great product! Highly recommend!!! This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!
Great Product!!! After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this.
"Great protection, decent performance I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids."
Great purchase My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!
Great purchase! Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them!

"Great starter tablet for a child I bought this tablet for my granddaughter. She loves it, it's easy for her to use, and just right for her size."
"Great Starter Tablet for Kids I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."
Great starter tablet. My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use.
Great tab for my young child Bought this for a 8 yr old and its perfect for what she like to do

Great tablet I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it
"Great tablet I bought this tablet for my son so he could have something to entertain him on our road trips. It works great. I love the child-proof case that it comes with. My only complaint is that the interface is slow sometimes. I'm honestly not surprised though, because it runs off of Android. I typically avoid Android but I figured I would give it a shot. After using this tablet, I think I will avoid using Android products again. Besides the slowness of the Android OS, it is still a great tablet."
Great Tablet I buy this tablet for my nephew and he is happy with it.
"Great Tablet I got this tablet to replace my sons old one, I love the adult/child profile and the ability to have the 2 year replacement warranty. The case has also came in handy many times."

Great tablet The kids love it and are always on it. Would recommend to anyone.
Great Tablet The Kindles were good while they worked 3 days!! Best Buy was good about replacing them. Very frustrating though to have to get them replaced when my kids only played on them for three days.
Great tablet This is one of the best kids tablets I have purchased. It's not as restricted and complicated to operate as other tablets I have tested.
"Great tablet Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100"

"Great tablet Works great for my daughter, great price and apps."
"Great tablet and a reasonable price I bough this for my daughter and it's perfect for her little tiny hands, I just wish that the screen would lock when she is watching her shows because she gets excited and touches the screen and it pauses or chances the show or it goes to other apps. Overall it's a great product for a small child"
Great tablet except... We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.
Great Tablet For 2 Year Old I'm very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it.
"Great tablet for 3 year old! My granddaughter had been using her parents' iPad and loves using apps for learning. I thought it would be nice for her to have her own tablet. My daughter loves the parental limits that can be set and my granddaughter loves not having to ""share"" with her parents!"

Great tablet for daughters 4th birthday Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom.

"Great Tablet for Kids Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app."

"Great tablet for kids This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things.

"Great Tablet for kids with Parental Control This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
"Great tablet for kids! I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!"

Great tablet for the kids My son loves the tablet. I like that Amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two years
Great tablet for the kids and book readings. Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
"Great tablet for the little ones I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!"
Great tablet for the little ones My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
Great tablet for toddler My 3yo loves it and never wants to put it down. Lots of preloaded educational games and videos!
"Great tablet for toddler My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it."
Great tablet for toddler Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
Great tablet for toddler Purchased this item after another tablet stopped working in less than a year of having. Couldn't go wrong with the two year no worry gurantee and the one year free subscription of Amazon FreeTime. Have had for about a month and it was been well worth the money already.
"Great tablet for toddlers Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect."

Great tablet for young children This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.
"Great tablet for young kids I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8."
Great tablet for young kids This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.
"Great Tablet, but it takes over 3 hours to charge When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead"
"Great tablet, just not for my daughter Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
great tablet! Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos
Great Tablet! I bought this tablet for my 1 year old and he loves it! It keeps him entertained when we go places and he has learned so much. The apps are great and perfect for him. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet.
Great Tablet! This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.

Great Tablet. I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily.

Great tablet. This tablet is great for a child. It will stand up to accidental drops and has just enough expandability for future use. I give it 5 star!
"Great tablet.. We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
Great tablet...but I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
GREAT tablets for kids I bought 2 of these tablets for my Grandsons that both have Autism. They can be very hard on things and this is 1 tablet neither boy has been able to break yet. they are very easy for them to use and they LOVE them. The only thing with them is you need an Amazon account for them.
Great tapblet This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.
Great tech toy for kids! I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
great the kids love it for learning on great the kids love it for learning on and great on long trips
Great tool for kids Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
"great toy and they can't tear it apart, fast S&H Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up"
Great TV for price I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
Great Value I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!
Great value and super warranty The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.
"Great Value for the Money Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing."
"great value for what it costs reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use"
great washer/Dryer for small family This washer and dryer is very basic but still nice with lots of options. Great for my small family. Worth the money!
"Great! Bought these for my 5yr old twin grandkids and the enjoy the learning games so much. Love that you can limit how long child is engaged with apps, games, or movies on this and that my daughter can use her amazon prime acct with this! 2yr amazon warranty is amazing as well"

Great. But... Great for the child. Unfortunately it doesn't have a volume limit setting
Greatest tablet for kids By far the greatest tablet for kids. Free time is fantastic. I don't have to worry about content for my child. And the two year worry free warranty is in heard of. 2 thumbs up
greats for kids This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe
Grewt for kids Is good for the kids The only thing is I have to get a SD Card for more memory
Happy kids Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this
Hard to set up Hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on.
has all you need bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy
Has held up to the abuse of a 5yr old. Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
He loved it! Purchased for an3 year old that wanted this badly. Appears to be rugged. Links up with my amazon account for content and access. 2 year warranty. Win!!!
Heaven on earth! My daughter hasn't put it down since Christmas. We're both in love! It's very easy for her to operate (she's 2) and very easy to set up. It's a win win for both parent and child.
Helps him learn Help my 2 year learn he loves to play it and watch movies on it
Helps reinforce reading habits Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find
"Hit of the Birthday Party Bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. She really enjoys it."
Horrible Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy!
Horrible So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
"How much fun it is to learn. Boy! If I had something like this when I was a kid. The learning devices these kids have today. Makes learning about different things in & around the world a fun experience. all the other activities & downloadable apps, they can be on it for hours. Like it!"
I bought it as a gift I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
"I expected limitations, I got limitations I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
"I got this for a gift We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too."
I like it I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
I like it but.... Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
I like the games and the books The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case
I love it Brought it for my niece for a Christmas and she loves it doesn't lag or anything it works just fine
I love it! I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.
"I purchased the item for my grandchild. My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink."
Impressive for kids Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
"Internet Issues You can not block Bing and it shows ""trending now"" News content. This can not be deleted or blocked. It also types ahead and adds content."
"IPAD for tots Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!"
It a great Tablet I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
It is a Christmas gift This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.
it is a great tablet for little ones my great grandson loves this he plays games and looks at all his pictureshe is only 2
It was a gift for my daughter... I bought this tablet because it was very inexpensive and the right size and fit for my daughter...
It's a great kindle size f My grandson can operate the kindle fire with no problem. Just the right size for his little hands.
It's a great tablet for kids I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
It's a Hit! Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!
It's a really good tablet. My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.
It's amazing device I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great
It's for my 4 yr. old grand daughter So it is working great. She loves the learning games
"It's good. Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
It's great for young kids. Definitely a good product children of all ages in elementary school.
"It's ok I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
"It's ok. It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible."
It's okay volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.
It's okay but Not fully parental controlling The parental control could be a lot better. It's nice and compact. She loves it
Its amazing my son don't put it down I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it
Just ok... Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
Kaylastablet My daughter can't get enough of this tablet. The only thing I would suggest that you have YouTube kids as a pre installed app. The adds are ridiculous for children when you download it from the App Store.
"Keeps kids busy It's a good tab for the kids, keeps them busy. Wish the speed was faster."
"Keeps My 2 Year Old Entertained Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!"
"Kept freezing Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
"Kid approved. My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips."
"Kid Entertaining This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don't want to do much else"
Kid friendly It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!
Kid friendly Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this.
"Kid friendly We had been using the Nabi for our 3 year old, but after the reviews online about the dreamtab we decided on the amazon fire kids tablet. So far so good. Very easy for our son to navigate without worry about getting on unauthorized websites."
Kid Friendly!!! I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!
Kid Kindle My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!
Kid loves it My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages

Kid tested kid approved This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.
"Kid's Kindle I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
Kids 1st tablet approved Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it
"Kids 7"" kindle fire My daughter loves it! She uses it with ease, which makes me an mommy very happy. No complaints. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Very helpful employees at Best Buy as well."
Kids Amazon Fire Tablet This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!
"Kids and technology Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device."
"Kids can't stop playing with their tablets! This tablet is great. Because it's from Amazon, you can easily switch to a different profile and use it when the kids finally put it down. I have 2 1/2 year old twins and it's hard to get them to sit down. With the Kid's Kindle Fire, they are more than happy to settle down on the couch and play. I highly recommend buying one. It is a life saver!"
kids fun Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better
Kids gift Very study tablets. 2 others grands liked theirs. Salesman was very helpful finding 2 different color models
kids kindle Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets.

"kids' kindle fire Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it."
"Kind of complicated I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product."
"Kinda good for my toodler Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics."
Kindle Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
Kindle My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
Kindle Fire for kids We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
Kindle for Great grestandson Kids Kindle was a Christmas present for great grandson age 4. His mother has downloaded many word games and etc. from Amazon's childrens library. A big feature of the Kindle is the case and the 2 year no fault warranty. His Mother says he loves the Kindle and uses it all the time. Great purchase.
kindle kids fire it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
Kindles rock My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.
"Liked it so much I bought two! Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games."
"Limited but Good I bought this for my daughter. It's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. She's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it."
"Looks good Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"

"Made my Christmas Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service....."
many features and easy to use Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.
Money's Worth The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it.
mostly great It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.

"My 18 month old loves this! My son loves this tablet, he will not put it down!"

She understands most of the apps and can navigate to watch whatever she wants. This comes with a warranty that if she does anything to break it, it will be replaced for free.

I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud.

My kids love it Got this for my kids they wont put it down but can be confusing with setup
"My kids love these These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
My little girl loves her tablet The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
"My nieces love it This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price."
My son didn't like it It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.
My son loves it He loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.
My son loves it i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe
"My son loves it I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though."
"my son loves it It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
My son loves it My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
My son loves it My son loves this product and uses it all the time.
My son loves it! My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.
My son loves it!! Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!!
my special needs daughter loves it My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter
"My three year old loves it This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty."

My two year old loves this tablet This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
"Name brand kids tablet for the price of a cheapie These kindle tablets are beginning to get pretty cheap. Especially when the other kids tablets are relatively close in pricing. Nothing has gone wrong with this Kindle as of now, and our niece has been enjoying it. A kids account and adult account is made. The kids accounts has access to whatever the adults account allows. This is pretty standard in kids tablets, but this one handles it well. It makes it much easier."
Neat I liked it a lot for my four year old and it is kids proof
needs an account The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
Neice loves it I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.
Nice It's a lovely game for kids wolf my daughter have one and I love it
Nice Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....
Nice 4 kids Nice for kids. Like the free apps built in the device. Can control what and how long they get to use screen time
"Nice but problematic This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating."
Nice device Bought for my grandson and the programs that were included with the device give a wide variety of education tools
Nice for kids Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it
Nice for the kids in the car Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
Nice for young hands Very sturdy for little people who might drop it easy to read
"nice innovative product for kids the product is really crafted for kids n they just glue to it as it offers an array of rich topics, apps, etc"
"Nice kids tablet Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!"
nice little tablet 4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
Nice little tablet I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
"Nice starter tablet for kids This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned."
Nice tablet Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
"Nice tablet for a kid Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own."
"Nice tablet for a kid Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case."
Nice tablet for a youngster My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.
Nice tablet for children The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
"Nice tablet for kids, case is great protection Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case"
Nice tablet for my little girl i always buy from best buy. they have excellent products.The workers are very knowledgeable of what they sell.Thanks
Nice tablet so far They had the tablet in stock and it is nice that it has the child settings
Nice Tablet with security features i can allow kids what i want them to read or play with
Nice tablrt This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild
"Nice to have when on the go I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
Not a bad product I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.
Not a bad tablet It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android
Not as good as I'd hoped I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
"not bad Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though"
Not bad Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
"Not bad I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this."
Not bad overall Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
Not for kids This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.
"Not for overseas! I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!"
"Not good Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone"
"not good this item is not good ok ...no use for my kids ,,,"
Not great tablet Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
Not impressed Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
Not just a toy Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
"Not kid friendly Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too."
Not kid friendly I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.
not kid friendly When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
Not meet needs Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
Not much useful I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.
Not so bad for a child Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy
Not the best specs but not bad for the price My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.
Not too kid friendly Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.
"Not what I was looking for I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
Ok tablet for kids I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
"Okay Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
Okay. Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
On Fire A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!
Our kid loves it. Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
Our son loves his tablet Our young son spends hours fully engaged playing games on his tablet.
Outstanding tablet for toddlers This tablet has been a great learning tool for my child.
"parent control, 2 year warranty, free down loads i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us."
Perfect Bought this for a grandchild. Perfect gift. Recommend this.
"Perfect Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it."
"Perfect ""laptop"" for a preschooler The guy at the store was really helpful. There was not a pink Fire Kids Edition so he looked on top of all the shelves and found one. My four year old grand daughter loves it."
"Perfect entertainment for my young great grandson. This was perfect for entertaining my 20-month old great grandson during car trips, shopping and bedtime."
"Perfect first tablet for toddler With a great child-proof case, this was the perfect tablet to start my little guy off with!"
Perfect for 8 yr old This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps!
Perfect for a 2 yr old the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy
Perfect for a child I own 3 Kindles. They are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. The case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. It's easy to use and she loves it.
Perfect for a toddler I bought this for my toddler and its perfect. He is rough with it and it still works. I wanted something that I use to teach him the basics of using a tablet and this worked great. It comes with a 2 yrs warranty.
Perfect for a toddler I have a 3 year old at home. Best purchase ever! Indestructible. Reliable. Easy to program. I would highly recommend this.
"Perfect for all ages So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine."
perfect for clumsy kids my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!
"Perfect for kids My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well"
"Perfect for kids Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
Perfect for kids! Easy to set up and turn on and off restrictions. Piece of mind that daughter can't access adult appropriate content
Perfect for kids! I like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. It has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .
Perfect for kids! My daughter loves this! Expandable storage helps when we make our twice yearly drive to Texas and all the games and apps are definitely age appropriate so I don't have to worry about get getting onto anything she isn't supposed to be on!
Perfect for Kids!! purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"Perfect for little kids Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books."
"Perfect for little ones Bought this for my grandniece, keeps her entertained. Can't beat the price."
Perfect for little ones It's all the great features of the Fire but with added bonuses for the kids. The app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.
"Perfect for Little Techies! My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
Perfect for my 3 year old My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.
"Perfect for my 3 year old This is perfect for my 3 year old. He loves this. The charger can be a little tricky at times, so I do have to be the one to plug it in. I've made sure to download a few of his favorite things on it for when we are offline & it's worked just fine. I will be buying an SD card soon to give him more room though, but we haven't run into any issues so far."
Perfect for my 4 year old Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.
Perfect for my 8 year old! I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.
Perfect for my grandaughter Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1
Perfect for my grandbabies These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.
Perfect for my granddaughter I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.
Perfect for my Grandson Perfect for my grandson I love the easy to use set up and parental control. I have recommended this to my friend for her children. Case is great
Perfect for my young kids. This has the all speed and storage I needed for my first grader. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
Perfect for occupying toddler We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.
"Perfect for our toddler The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows"
Perfect for the kids I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.
"PERFECT FOR THE PURPOSE I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee."
Perfect for toddlers This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.
Perfect for young kids My kids love their kindles and love free time in it. Numerous educational games!
Perfect for young kids! Piece of mind that the little one won't wonder the World Wide Web and be exposed to things no parent wants to have to explain!
"Perfect for youngsters My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands."
"Perfect gift Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself"
Perfect gift I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.
perfect gift its a great great gift that can be used by everyone
Perfect gift My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.
Perfect gift for any age! My 3 year old has one and my 10 year old wanted one so now they BOTH have one. The parental controls are easy to use and work great. I would highly recommend to anyone!
"Perfect Gift for kids I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it."
"Perfect kid tablet Got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! Lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. What really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that Amazon offers!"
"Perfect Tab This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it."
"Perfect tablet and features for a child I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied."
"Perfect tablet for kids The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids."
"Perfect tablet for my kids, nephew and nieces. I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids."
"Perfect tablet for my kids, nieces and nephew This tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. It has lots of fun apps for the kids."
"Perfect tablet for my littles We bought these knowing we had a couple of long plane rides ahead of us...we have not regretted them one bit. They are easy to use for the kids, come with lots of fun apps/games/books...Best part for us was being able to add a memory card, so we could add movies and as many apps as we needed without worrying about space."
"Perfect tablet for the Littles Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
PERFECT!! My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.
Perfectly preloaded I love that this tablet came preloaded. All we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level.
Playtime for hours Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.
POOR QUALITY I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
"Pretty darn decent! My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"Pretty good piece of equipment for the kiddos My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"Pretty Neat Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera"
"Pretty solid for the price Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
"Processor is slow My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version."
Product Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
Product Issues This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
Product Made for Kids and Adults alike I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.
"Purchased for my daughter This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus"
"Really great Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
Reasonably priced Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
Recommend Don't shop around! Great parental controls. Easy to set up
"Recommend for 4-8yr olds. Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
"Regular Tablet Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. I will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product"
Review My daughter loves her tablet. I couldn't have made a better purchase.
Save your money This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
"send back did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying."
she loves it she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
"She loves it! I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
Should be great for grand daughter Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
Simple to use A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops
Slight learning curve but nice tablet We got this for our three year old daughter. At first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my iPad
Slow performance Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
"Small screen for books and videos The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft."
"So far so good It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
"So far so good Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer."
"So far, no negative comments..... I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it."
"So far, so good! Bought this for a 2 year old. She loves it! She's already got more things figured out on it than I do!. Good educational programs and some fun ones too!"
"So happy I am so very i got this for my 3 year old grandson. He can navigate it to get to his favorite shows, Peppa pig, Mickey clubhouse and Thomas the train. He is so happy with his tablet."
"So improved in last 2 yrs Better loading, longer battery life, clearer picture, more space. Still just as durable!"
"so so After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg"
So so You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
"Solid product Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The 'excited factor' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either."
Son is happy My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome
Son loves his tablet My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
Son loves it Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
Son loves it Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.
Son loves kids kindle Easy to navigate and my son just loves it pkus a year free of service.
Son loves this tablet Great purchase for my son's 6th birthday. He love it and the kid account is a great addition
"Son's first tablet My two year old loves the videos,games and books this tablet provides."
Still learning to use it. Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it.
"Sturdy Tablet I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long."
Sturdy tablet My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!
Such a great purchase Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
"Super easy to use kid's tablet This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling."
super learning tool kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there
Super slow It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
Surprise! Was a great birthday present for my son that only gets to use it when it's absolutely necessary.
Switched from Samsung Galaxy Tablet to Fire Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.
tablet nice and easy-to-use for a 3 yr old ..............
Tablet The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.
"tablet fever I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet"
Tablet for a small child This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.
Tablet for children I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
Tablet for children It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device
Tablet for kid Gift for great nephew. Have 2 that are 5 and 6 y/o. Both love these tablets because each got one. Play with them as much as Mom allows.
Tablet for kid Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.
"Tablet for kids Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift."
"Tablet for my 8 year old Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
Tablet not for kids Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
Teresa This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!
"The baby love's it The tablet is just what a child needs, it's tuff and the content is aimed at the children's needs. It keeps them entertained as long as you will let them."
The baby loves it ‚ù§ This tablet has great storage capacity. I have downloaded all kinds of children's movies and learning activities. It's great.
The camera and Cover are great Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.
The grandkids are going to love this! I have a kindle fire and love mine so I decided to get one for each of the grandkids. There are so many learning games that are fun for them plus you have parental control
"The Grandkids LOVE It!!! The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better!"
The great tablet for children. We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.
"The kids LOVE it! :) My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away."
"The tablet not so great as mentioned The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
"This is a great next step tablet for kids. My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case."
This is a great tablet for kids I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new.
"This is a MUST with kids! Where do I begin? It comes with an amazing thick case, it's a fully functioning tablet. It also comes with a one year subscription to educational games and movies/ shows. If it breaks Amazon replaces! How could you choose any other tablet? This was so great we had to get two!"
"This is a tablet for the kids. I was impressed with the overall of this Kindle, it has so many nice features and easy access."
This is great This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.
"This is the 2d I bought I bought one last year for my 1 1/2 years old granddaughter and believe me, she loves it. She deals with it perfectly. We put a 128 GB card and downloaded music, videos and movies. And she finds everything. A few days ago I bought another for my twins grankids. They are only 11 month old but we are going to start putting their music and movies. With the bluetooth they will enjoy it. I got a Free in-store set up so their mom will learn how to use it."
"This tablet is great for my child. My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it."
"This was a good investment for my grandson. I bought the Tablet for my grandson for Christmas. It was the best investment that I have made in all time. He is learning so much that he can't put it down. As a matter of fact, he sleeps this it just about every night."
This was an excellent choice for a 3 year old I purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter after having purchased her older sister one last year when she was 3. It's comforting knowing it has as durable cover to endure the energy of a toddler.
Thumbs up Good value for the price and for the children. The apps are enough to let them play and read.
Too many pop up ads We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
Touch response is not good Touch response is not so good. so my kid refused to play games on this.Returned this product. Thanks to Bestbuy for the full refund
"User friendly, easy set up My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading"
"Very awesome! So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!"
Very child friendly. Glad that I get to control the time spent on which sure site and apps.
"Very disappointing purchase I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me."
"Very durable Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
very durable works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet
Very educational Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it
Very Entertaining My 3 year old daughter loves playing on her fire. The apps are all very entertaining and easy enough for her to use.The only thing I have had difficulty with is accessing youtube or the internet.
Very good Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.
Very good The service was great and the help I received thanks
Very good product The kids couldn't wait to turn them on and I'm very excited.
Very good resolution My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.
"Very good table for the price This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty."
"very good value Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads"
Very happy So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
Very Happy Granddaughter This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
Very happy with the kindle fire Love how easy it is for my 9 year old sone to navigate around. The unlimited kindle free time is great too we like that we are able to set time limits as well as only allow age appropriate games and content. Our son Not only loves playing Minecraft and watching netflix on it but enjoys the reading the books as well.
Very interactive This was a gift to my niece. Her mom liked the parental controls
Very nice! We purchased this as a gift and the feedback we have received has been great.
very satisfied with it's easy operation I will recommend for other parents to buy this product
Wait till it goes on sale. There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
"Well constructed This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!"
Well priced tablet for kids The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
"Well protected for kids It's really a good product to buy for kids. A lot of educational games . They can their favorite kids show from youtube, Netflix etc. The cover is really good. I'm gonna another one for my daughter."
Well worth the purchase May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained.
"What makes this a kid edition?? 7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge."
Will keep kids busy Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
"Won't break This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use."
Wonderful BC starter tablet I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding
Wonderful for kids Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!
"Wonderful for my granddaughter My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it."
"Wonderful Item for Kids This is a great tablet for kids. Keeps them busy with so much to do, watch, and create."
Wonderful tablet for any age. Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.
Wonderful tablet for kids I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.
"Wonderful tablet for kids Love this for my youngest. He had a Nabi, but it just wasn't as user friendly as this is."
"Workman tablet for kids I bought this as a gift for my elementary school aged niece. She immediately put it to work playing games and watching video. Her face lit up and in the nearly two months since I purchased it for her, she's had no problems!"
"Works great Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty."
Works great for 3 yr old Simple to operate for a 3 yr old . Would recommend
Works great my grandson loves it Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues
"Works great, glad we bought it. Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device"
Works well I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
"Works well and kid friendly I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."
Works well. Grandson picked it up & used it right away. He enjoys the tablet.
works wonders for my son my son has been using our computer and we got him this and he never looked back.
"Worth it I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product."
"Wouldn't buy any other brand I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it."
"Wow! What a deal! Such a great deal for a small fee, just right for a toddler of three."
Yes I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids
Yes This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
"You pay for what you get This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far."
"A good step up from my old kindle tablet The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 32gb Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
amazon fire hd8 meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
Amazon Fire Tablet Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
"Amazon HD8 granddaughter tablet She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL"
"Amazon tablet This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
AWESOME BUY Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!!
Awesome product Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.
Awesome tablet Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.
Awesome tablet!! Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
Best gift My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
"Best tablet on the market Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
"Big upgrade from the 7"" Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
"Does the job I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."
"Easy reader Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
"Easy to navigate, great product Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
Easy to use Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
"Easy to use and handle This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
"Easy to use and perfect for kids My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps"
"Easy to use and set up I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear."
Easy to use for beginner or advanced user! This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
Exceeded my expectations I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
"Excellant Purchase! Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!!"
excellent Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.
Excellent Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!
"Excellent buy Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."
Excellent buying experience This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
"Excellent Portable Media Device / Backup Tablet This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
Excellent product but granddaughter wanted an iPad I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.
"Excellent Tablet This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
"expanded storage can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup."
"Fire HD 8 I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
"First time tablet owner Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"
Fun new toy This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
Geat tablet for everyone So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .
goes off I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
Good - But could be much better. Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
Good basic tablet Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
Good for me The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
"Good for movies and amazon Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
good product This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading
"good product for kids Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
"good quality good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
Good tablet for the average person. I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
"Good tablet. Not great, but good. I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
Great Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable
"Great Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting."
Great It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
"great Amazon device If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
Great buy Great tab for my kids. This is the third fire tablet that we have purchased for our kids.
Great buy Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
Great Choice All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
Great Device I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
Great Device! Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.
Great for everyone - not just the avid reader Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
"Great for games A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
great for reading this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me
"Great for travel Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc."
"Great for watching movies Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift."
"Great for what it does! When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!"
"Great for younger kids Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
Great for your Prime access I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.
Great gaming device This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
Great gift! Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
Great gift! This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.
Great inexpensive tablet I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.
Great inexpensive tablet Ok so in order to get three working well I needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy. All is great! Kids love them!
"Great item for readers. I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos"
Great little tablet Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.
great pad for both children and adults Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
"Great price on an awesome little tablet I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."
Great product I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.
Great product I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
great product this is my second one and must have one of these at all times
"GREAT PRODUCT AND PRICE Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service"
"Great product, pick up process was fast Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus."
great reader my dautgher loves it my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.
Great reading device I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.
Great tablet Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.
Great Tablet Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do.
Great tablet Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
Great Tablet Great tablet for those invested in the Amazon system. Nice screen and functions well.
Great tablet I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
Great tablet My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!!
Great tablet This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.
Great tablet This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
"Great tablet for anyone Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
Great tablet for the price Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
"Great tablet for young kids Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
"Great Tablet with lots of functionality. I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."
Great work giveaway item Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
"Great. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."
"Happier than I expected I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
"HD makes big difference I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
"I cherish my kindle it's my window to the world. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
I like the bigger screen. My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
I love my kindle ! The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
I was expecting more It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
"IN MY VIEW, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST READING TABLET GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
It was everything I was looking for. Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.
"It's an ok tablet for the price. In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
"Kindle Fire is great for reading New Kindle Fire 8 is easy to setup, great for reading, no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network. I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet."
"less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast! Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
"Love a kindle A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
"love it easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load"
Love it I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.
Love it Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use
Love it!!! I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
"Love my Fire Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
"Love my Kindle It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
"Love My Kindle This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle."
Love my kindle This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
Love my Kindle Fire I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.
Love this Kindle Fire Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.
Luv this Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
My daughter in law loved it! Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
My granddaughter is happy with her Fire HD8 I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
"my Kids love them Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
My wife loves it We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air
New kindle I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
Newer & better Kindle Fire I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
"Nice Amazon tablet This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
Nice for Streaming Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
Nice for the price If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.
Nice Kindle Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
Nice product Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.
Nice tablet Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
Nice tablet My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!
Nice tablet Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
"Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
Not so good! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
"Now do not have to carry around a laptop. This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
"Overall great But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
Perfect for the reader Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.
Really like for reading books at Lunch My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
Returned I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
"Serves my tablet needs perfectly For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
So far so good.. So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
Students will love this! I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
Super fast tablet love it! Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
Tab Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
Tablet for the kiddo Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
"Tablet works pretty good, just getting started. I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
"techy kids will like great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
Terrible I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
"Terrific Tablet! Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."
The Fire is good for the price I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
The kindle fire HD 8 is really great! It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast!
"Unexpected Tablet I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
Very good product Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
Very good product - easy to use Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
"Very Good Tablet Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
Very happy Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
Very nice This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
"Wife Loves it Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
Works great Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
"2yr old approved Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all."
"A good starter but not for the impatient My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these ""kids"" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell."
"A good value This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
"A Great first tablet My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose."
"A great little computer Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,"
A great table for kids My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It's great.
A Kindle that's kid resistant A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. Great deal on a great product.
A nice gift for my grandaughter to learn her ABCs My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.
A real home run This is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.
A real value We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.
"A very good Tablet for kids I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."
Age Appropriate Interface My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.
Agreat gift for the grandkids The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
"alright tablet Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users."
Amazing My daughter loves this. There are so many settings and you don't have to buy every app individual. So many books and educational apps :)
Amazing My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it
"amazing and unique This tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end."
Amazing product This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend
"Amazon - Fire Kids Edition I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked."
Amazon - Fire Kids Edition This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.
Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is FIRE !!!! The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips
Amazon 7-inch fire kids tablet Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily
Amazon did great with this product Love the color pink for granddaughter she loves carrying around her own tablet. Wonderful product. love the safety protective case great unit.
Amazon Fire Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.
"Amazon Fire kids edition 7 Tablet 16 gb We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this"
"Amazon kid version Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend."
An Excellant Christmas gift for grandchild! I got this tablet for my 3 year old granddaughter. She enjoys it and it keeps her busy and learning. Everything rolled into one for her.
"An OK tablet This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80"
Awesome Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!
"Awesome Great for kids, bought both colors for two of my kids."
"Awesome Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well!"
Awesome Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning
Awesome Great tablet with good parental controls for kids!!
Awesome Have had other products similar for the kids but this is the best by far. Best Buy had a great price too so decided to try it. Love it.
Awesome I love this table for my 4 year old. Ttje parental controls are Awesome! I also like that it changes up the games for her so she won't get board!
"Awesome I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick."
Awesome My 4 year old loves it. I love that she can use it unsupervised without worry. She has been learning her alphabet and this has been a great tool.
Awesome My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!
Awesome My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.
Awesome My little 8 year old guy loves this kindle. Couldn't imagine a better Christmas gift.
Awesome My son is a huge fan of it and I love that I can control what he watches and plays
Awesome This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.
"Awesome device for a young child I bought the first kindle years ago for my sister. When my oldest turned 1, he wouldn't leave her kindle alone. We decided to buy him one & he has had it ever since. The learning apps such as the counting ones, ones about learning shapes, and learning his ABCs, assists in his advancement in his schooling. We all have a kindle in the house, to include my 3 year old (this is his first year with one). Love it!"
"Awesome for rough kids My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!"
Awesome for toddlers Bought it for my granddaughter. She is so smart. She can get on and find her apps. She lives the videos and games.
Awesome for toddlers with slippery fingers! My 3 year old has gone through 2 tablets prior to her kids fire. I love the parental control and easy use. She loves the apps available through Prime! She drops it daily with no damage to the tablet thanks to the protective case! Thanks for making a very durable product with an incredible warranty!
Awesome fun for toddlers and older I bought this as a gift for my grandkids. They absolutely love it!
Awesome kid gift I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!!
Awesome Kid's Tablet Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
"Awesome kids tablet Bought as Christmas gift. He loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
"Awesome kids tablet Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
"awesome kindle I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that's all that matters."
Awesome product! My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down!
"AWESOME SAUCE This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi."
Awesome tablet This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
"Awesome tablet for a 5 year old!!!! I especially loved the bumper that protects it! He absolutely loved this gift! It has parental control. It has the ability to buy games that are educational for him; and we are all thrilled with it....myself, his parents and our little guy!!!!"
Awesome tablet for a child! Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!
"Awesome tablet for kids for the price you cant beat this, my daughter loves it and wont put it down and the protective case def helps when it is dropped trust me , cannot go wrong with a kindle for this price"
Awesome tablet for kids I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.
Awesome Tablet for Kids This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops.
Awesome tablet for toddler Easy to set up. Durable for toddlers. Highly recommend.
"Awesome tablet for young children I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone."
awesome tablet. My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...
Awesome! Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.
Awesome! My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She
Awesome! This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
"Awesome!!! I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work."
Awesomely safe & Educational It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids
Awsome Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.
Baby loved it My son loves his tablet. It is very easy to use. Very stutdy.
"Bad plug The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
"Be aware these require a credit card I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
Beautiful design Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it
"Beginner tablet it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
Best Buy for Christmas Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter!
best child's tablet This is the best child's tablet and some adults like me can benefit from the warranty and matched case
best for the younger kids Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we!
"Best gift I ever purchased for my grandchildren! Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!"
Best kids tablet I needed this for my daughter and needed a tablet that cal handle all my daughters apps and have parental saggy This has it all
"Best Kindle for my needs* This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
Best possible choice I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.
Best purchase ever I bought this for my grandson and it hasn't disappointed me at all! He loves his tablet! I am looking at buying his sister one next!
"Best purchase for 4 yr old purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it."
Best tablet My daughter loved it . Best gift for the price it comes with way more then I could have expected
Best Tablet This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
Best Tablet EVER!!! Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
"Best tablet ever!!! My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome"
Best tablet for kids Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
"Best tablet for kids I'm a father of two. Both of my kids (6) & (10) got iPads last year for Christmas and love them, but I felt the iPad was lacking a little of what they really need. Purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. Perfect kids tablet. Don't make the mistake I did and go with the IPad. This product nails it in every aspect the iPad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet"
"best tablet for the money Bought it for our 2 year old son, has really helped with his vocabulary"
Best Tablet for Toddlers Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.
Best tablet for young children Son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. Nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. No questions asked.
Best Tablet out there for a toddler Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.
"Best tablet out there for kids!! I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!"
"Better and Better Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use."
better than a nabi 2 my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.
Birthday gift Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
Birthday gift Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
"bloaaattted WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
bloated Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
Bought for grandsons This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
"Bought for my grandchildren Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
bought for my grandson and he loves it. I got this because it is almost impossible to break
Boy tablet I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
Charging plug The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
"Charging Ports I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
"Child friendly! Great gift, for my kid's second birthday! This product is very child friendly and easy to use! I recommend this product for families!"
Child Kindle Review My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
childrens kindle great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
ChildsPlay This is the way to go for an all-in-one package for the kids. Everything is set-up and easily controlled through adult log in...
"Christmas Gift This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy."
"christmas present This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it."
Christmas Presents So far it begin good for my 4yrs old toddler. She enjoy every minute of it.The parental control it's a plus. It also allow you to make multiple kid and adults profiles without any problems issues.
"Chronic issue with charging port The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
"Daughter love it! My daughter is learning so much from the games on this device, my wife was glad I bought it."
"Daughter loves it!! My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!"
Decent My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained
Decent game so far I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
Decent item Purchased this for my son. Decent tablet but not optimum
"Decent Kids Edition This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
Decent tablet for kids Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
"Decent tablet for younger kids I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
Device is not as rugged as it could be returning returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
Did not work properly. It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
"Disappointed doesn't play Netflix So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
"Disappointing product. Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!"
Do not recommend for 1yr old. My Mistake to buy for 1yr old.But my 30yr old son enjoys it!
"Does what it says, missing one key feature There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated."
"Don't like...too hard to download other apps I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
Durable Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
durable and fun tablet for kids I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.

Easy for kids granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.
Easy for my 3 year old to use Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.
Easy setup This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.

Easy to use This was purchased for my grandson. It has been easy for him to use. Love the parental controls and free time mode. The included bumper case is a bonus.
"Easy to use for my 9 yr old My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection."
"Easy to use for our seven year old Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."

"easy to work not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged (me) I find it easy to work with"

Educational This tablet was bought for my 4 year old. She uses it to learn.
"Eh My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
Entertains my Granddaughter She loves it. She is 20 months old and already has command of it. Micky and Minnie rule it!

Excellent children's edition!!! It was easy to set up. My grandson has enjoyed the broad selection of activities from which to choose.
"Excellent choice I bought this for my grand daughter, she previously had a Nabi. I like the fact that she can use the hot spot on our phones and she can log on to view her favorite shows.My grand daughter is seven, but she also looks at movies and programs that her one year old brother can enjoy. The tablet is light enough to take along any where. It also has a protective shell which is a plus when you have an active seven year old."
Excellent combo This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set
"Excellent for children! My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
"Excellent for kids Got 2 of these for my two oldest daughters, 5 and 3. Perfect for them and love the features. Battery life seems pretty long. The year of freetime plus the case makes it worth it! Will be getting another for my 3rd daughter's 2nd birthday."
Excellent for toddlers! My daughter absolutely loves this! It is very user friendly. My only issue with it would be that it doesn't come with a camera automatically installed.
Excellent gift for grandkids Excellent gift for my grandkids. They love it and play with it all the time.
Excellent gift for grandkids Proved to be an excellent Christmas gift for both grandkids. They love it
"Excellent introductory tablet for youngelr kids Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit"
"Excellent kids tablet I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also."
Excellent learning device for my son My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer
Excellent my grandson loves it! My Grandson uses it all the time. It was a great choice!
"Excellent parental settings You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip."

Excellent tablet for kids Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!
Excellent Tablet for kids Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full
Excellent Tablet for Kids My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode.

Fair The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
Fantastic Our 5 year old grandson loved it. Bought it for him to play educational games on.
Fantastic Parental controls are key. My boys can download games within the parameters I set and I get notification of any purchases. 2 year no questions asked replacement is key.
Fantastic tablet for kids This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.
"Fantastic!! My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."
Fire Away! This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
Fire kids edition I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
"Fire Kids Edition - 7"" Tablet - 16GB - P Great for kids. The bumper around the tablet has saved it several times. I might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around. The programs are easy to access and love the parental controls."
Fire Kids table My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
"Fire Kids Tablet The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far."
"For grandson Great for a 2 yr old, and will use it till he's older"
"For my 3 y/o I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!"
For my 3 year old son I did some looking in the web and after looking at many tablets this was the best choice.
"For my daughter This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety."
For my granddaughter She loves to be on the tablet all the time . So now she will have her own.

Fun My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained
Fun for kids It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
Fun games for little ones Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet!
Fun learning & entertaining I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
Fun product Needs to be a way to lock screen. Kiddo loves the device for books and movies on long road trips but accidentally turns off screen or clicks out of it.
"Game Changer The best device for a child in the market. Purchased for an infant and after two weeks, he is loving it. Easy to handle and durable."

Good for kids My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.
"good for kids This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
Good for Kids We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.

"Good product but hard to setup for Grandson This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
Good size I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps

Good Tablet for Toddlers to Teen Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..

Good tablets for the grandkids Grandkids loved the tablets and they seem very durable and long-lasting
"Good Value We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
Good value and well made for a four year old I ordered the extra case not knowing the device came with a case.
Good warranty and protection Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
"Good working tablet This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."

Great beginner tablet My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I'd highly recommend this product
"great beginners kids tablet The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"
Great bumper The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
"Great but aggravating at times My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
"Great Buy Bought this for my 3 kids aged 9,7,and 2. They all use it with ease. They each have their own account with appropriate games. We like the protective cover that absorbs drops and falls well."
Great buy Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.

"great buy My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music."
Great buy Purchased for our 3 year old grandson. He loves it.
"Great buy This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly."
Great buy! Kids Love it! I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.

Great camera for a beginner My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
Great camera to take photos The grandson likes the learning games that are on the tablet. You can see the progress in his learning from the time he has used it
"Great choice for kids! We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!"
Great computer My 3yr old just loves it keeps her occupied for hours
Great device Bought for my 3 year old. Very rugged and easy to use. Love it uses the android apps and kiddo loves it.
"Great Device My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it."
Great device for a toddler ! I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks
Great device for a younger child Device size and speed are more than adequate for an 8 year old. I love Freetime and the ability to set limits for weekdays and weekends so my grandson is able to play without my direct supervision. Apps and books are age appropriate. I may have to buy 2 more for the 4 year olds.
"Great device for child entertainment My children loved it, and it is great learning tool."
Great device for kids I like it so and so my kids like it very much.The application is amazing.
"Great Device for Kids to Learn I bought this device recently for my daughter, she likes it very much. She learning new things. I also gifted this device to my friends Son."
"Great device for my grandchildren Bought 3 for my young grandkids exceptional security for kids, great babysitter as well as educational tool"
"Great device for my grandchildren I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase."
Great device for our grandson. This device provides necessary app and is extremely user friendly.
"Great Device! We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. The kids love it and it is simple to use. The ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. We can switch to our profile to watch Netflix or use other apps if we want. Comes with a great warranty and device protector. We're very happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet."
Great educational tool My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy
Great educational tool for kids Great way to get kids introduced to using a tablet. A ton of free software is available. Guarantee seals the deal.
"Great first tab My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his"
"Great first tablet Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks"
Great fit for my 2 year old Everything he needs but nothing more. The case looked a little flimsy but it has been great so far.
"Great for 5 Year Old Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day."
"Great for 5 year olds This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time."
"Great for a 2 year old I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that."
"Great for a 3 year old. Great tablet for a little kid. I was debating between this and an ipad but figured an ipad would be way too much for a tablet. Its nice because you can switch users. If you want something simple , then this is the one for you."
"Great for a 4 year old! Very easy for my child to navigate. It was very easy to set it up. All the games, books and internet that's pre-loaded is awesome and so convenient"
"Great for a Beginner I bought this for my 6yr-old & am impressed w/the 1yr subscription to free-time that was included, and the additional 2yr manufacturer warranty. The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!"
"Great for a Beginner I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!"
Great for a child I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. She loves the number of books she is able to access. It wasd a Christmas hit!
Great for a kid Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!

Great for Children.

We had bought several DVD players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. Now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read.

"Great for the kids... no Google Play Store These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
"Great for the price and the kids Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week."

Great for young kids It's a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level.
"Great for young kids Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me."
Great for young kids learning My son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and I can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc.. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.
Great for young users The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.

"Great gift for my grandsons They both love it! And, play or read all they can."
Great gift for the little ones I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.
Great gift for young children I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational.

Great kids tablet Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet
Great kids tablet I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint
"Great kids tablet I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful."
"Great kids tablet I bought this tablet for my 5-year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. It's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games."
Great kids tablet I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
"Great kids tablet I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"
great kids tablet love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
"Great kids tablet my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price"
Great kids tablet My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was
Great kids tablet My kids really enjoyed this tablet. Its kid friendly...
Great kids tablet This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.
"Great kids tablet This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
Great kids tablet This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
Great kids tablet..hours of fun and education I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer.
Great kindle fire for kids I like the fact that there is parental control plus by putting your child's age the kindle will only send you games that are designed for your child's age
Great kindle for a toddler Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person
Great kindle for kids My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!
Great kindle for kids This is a great kindle for kids to use as it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down.
Great learning and developmental tool. I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing 1 for another grandchild in October. They love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them.
Great learning tablet for children I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
great learning tool my granddaughter has learned a lot of educational things on hers
Great learning tool for kids This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.
Great little gadget I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.
"Great little tablet I purchased this for my youngest grandson, age 4 for christmas and he will be receiving it shortly. Games have been downloaded and it will be charged and ready to use when he opens his gift."
"Great little tablet This was purchased for my older grandson, age 6, for Christmas and as I stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him."
Great old time games Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer
Great option for child This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
Great Pad for a child My grandson used my old I Phone to play on. Got him this tablet and he loves it! Great deal!
Great price but beware - not all apps work I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
"Great price! I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!"
Great Product Bought for my 3 year old and she loves it! Haven't had any issues!
Great product Bought this item for my 1 yr old and at first would not pay attention to it since he loves to run around. But when we are out its a good tablet for a kid and very durable since kids tend to drop toys. We use it to watch movies and even kid educational apps. It's a good buy for the price and to entertain the kids. Video quality is very good.

"Great purchase for my daughter My wife and I bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help keep her entertained during car rides, etc.. well now she is completed addicted to it.

"Great Starter Tablet for Kids I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."

Overall it's a great product for a small child"
Great tablet easy used to use for 2 year old. I liked it so much I will e getting all my grandkids one for birthdays from now on.
Great tablet except... We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.

Great tablet for daughters 4th birthday Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom.

The case has been a savior for a few drops. My daughter loves the size of the tablet. The 2 year replacement plan and 1 year unlimited FreeSpace makes this the perfect tablet for my child. She loves that she doesn't have to ask everytime she wants a new game or video. We chose to expand the memory up to 128gb with a microsd and so no worries about running out of storage space! My only complaint is that the battery life isn't anywhere near the power of an iPad. So keep your charger with you!"

great tablet for kids and adults..... Kindle Fire meets the needs of kids and/or adults-
"Great Tablet for kids with Parental Control This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device.

Great tablet for kids! Bought one of these for each of my grandkids and they love it!

Great tablet for the kids and book readings. Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
"Great tablet for the little ones I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!"
Great tablet for the little ones My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
Great tablet for toddler My 3yo loves it and never wants to put it down. Lots of preloaded educational games and videos!
"Great tablet for toddler My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it."
Great tablet for toddler Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
Great tablet for toddler Purchased this item after another tablet stopped working in less than a year of having. Couldn't go wrong with the two year no worry gurantee and the one year free subscription of Amazon FreeTime. Have had for about a month and it was been well worth the money already.
Great tablet for toddlers. I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.
Great tablet for young child This tablet is perfect for a young child. The case it comes with is wonderful and seems very protective.
Great tablet for young children This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.
Great tablet for young kids Great for kids its durable and lets them play games etc.. so they leave our cell phones alone LOL
"Great tablet for young kids I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8."
Great tablet for young kids I love this tablet. I got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it.
Great tablet for young kids This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.
Great tablet for youth The child that this item was purchased for hasn't put it down. He is really enjoying it!
"Great Tablet, but it takes over 3 hours to charge When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead"
"Great tablet, just not for my daughter Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
great tablet! Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos
Great Tablet! I bought this tablet for my 1 year old and he loves it! It keeps him entertained when we go places and he has learned so much. The apps are great and perfect for him. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet.
Great Tablet! This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.
Great Tablet. I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily.
Great tablet. This tablet is great for a child. It will stand up to accidental drops and has just enough expandability for future use. I give it 5 star!
"Great tablet.. We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
Great tablet...but I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
GREAT tablets for kids I bought 2 of these tablets for my Grandsons that both have Autism. They can be very hard on things and this is 1 tablet neither boy has been able to break yet. they are very easy for them to use and they LOVE them. The only thing with them is you need an Amazon account for them.
Great tapblet This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.
Great tech toy for kids! I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
great the kids love it for learning on great the kids love it for learning on and great on long trips
Great tool for kids Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
"great toy and they can't tear it apart, fast S&H Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up"
Great TV for price I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
Great Value I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!
Great value and super warranty The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.
"Great Value for the Money Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing."
great washer/Dryer for small family This washer and dryer is very basic but still nice with lots of options. Great for my small family. Worth the money!
"Great! Bought these for my 5yr old twin grandkids and the enjoy the learning games so much. Love that you can limit how long child is engaged with apps, games, or movies on this and that my daughter can use her amazon prime acct with this! 2yr amazon warranty is amazing as well"
Great! Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too!
Great! Love it!! My two year old loves to watch Sesame Street & football
Great! Purchased for our niece. She is 6 years old and it's perfect for her. She loves it!
Great!!! Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.
Greater starter for my 2 yr. old grandson Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it.
"Greatest tablet ever My other daughter has this same tablet, so I knew it would be a winner with my other child as well."
Greatest tablet for kids By far the greatest tablet for kids. Free time is fantastic. I don't have to worry about content for my child. And the two year worry free warranty is in heard of. 2 thumbs up
greats for kids This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe
Happy kids Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this
has all you need bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy
Has held up to the abuse of a 5yr old. Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
Have not yet used the product. Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product.
He likes it... He loves it. Helps him learn and teaches him how to count
Helps reinforce reading habits Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find
Hidden fees After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.
"Hit of the Birthday Party Bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. She really enjoys it."
Horrible So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
Huge hit This was a huge hit with my seven-year-old grandson. I came in to replace a broken tablet and they were no longer available. So I chose this one and it's better than ever!
I bought it as a gift I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
"I expected limitations, I got limitations I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
"I got this for a gift We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too."
I like it I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
I like it but.... Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
I like the games and the books The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case
I love it Brought it for my niece for a Christmas and she loves it doesn't lag or anything it works just fine
I love it I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k
I love it I love it and I brought two more for my Grandson and God Daughter.
I love it! I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.
"I purchased the item for my grandchild. My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink."
Impressive for kids Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
"IPAD for tots Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!"
"It was a Christmas present, so far so good. I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time."
It's a great tablet for kids I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
It's a really good tablet. My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.
It's amazing device I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great
It's does it job! The fire kid edition 7 is good but not great. Volume is pretty low. But my son throws it around and it doesn't break. Case is stone hard. I also the the brightness on the screen can be a bit low.
It's for my 4 yr. old grand daughter So it is working great. She loves the learning games
"It's good. Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
It's great for young kids. Definitely a good product children of all ages in elementary school.
"It's ok I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
"It's ok. It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible."
It's ok.. I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow
It's okay volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.
It's okay but Not fully parental controlling The parental control could be a lot better. It's nice and compact. She loves it
It's okay but.... The tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid Apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that Amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other I'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to Apple it will take some getting used to.
Its amazing my son don't put it down I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it
Just ok... Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
"Keeps My 2 Year Old Entertained Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!"
"Kept freezing Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
"Kid approved. My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips."
"Kid Entertaining This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don't want to do much else"
Kid friendly It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!
Kid friendly Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this.
"Kid friendly We had been using the Nabi for our 3 year old, but after the reviews online about the dreamtab we decided on the amazon fire kids tablet. So far so good. Very easy for our son to navigate without worry about getting on unauthorized websites."
Kid Friendly!!! I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!
Kid Kindle My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!
Kid Loves it Kindle fire is extremely easy to use. The protective foam layer is awesome.
Kid loves it My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages
Kid proof tablet Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy
Kid Tablet My daughter loves her tablet I love free time love the case it came with just right to buy for a kids first tablet
Kid tested kid approved This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.
"Kid's Kindle I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
Kiddo LOVES it Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.
Kids 1st tablet approved Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it
Kids Amazon Fire Tablet This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!

Kids love it... Probably a little too much but the device has excellent parental controls. They have used it for about a week so far with no issues.
Kids love them My kids love these. I purchased 3 of them at one time. They seem really durable.
"Kids love these My children think these are the greatest. I'm kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank."
Kids loved it A few problems with games loading but over all good
"kids loved it great tablet for children, lots of content. games books etc and easy for my 4 y.o to use."
"Kids loved it! Great, non-expensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my Ipad."
Kids Tablet Bought this nice kindle fire kids tablet for my 18 month son for a 6 hour road trip to LA and it did the job. I downloaded some movies and apps from Amazon to keep the little guy busy. He absolutely loved it and best thing is the case it's very durable. Plus with 2 year guarantee if anything happens they'll replace it for free. We both love it!
Kids Tablet It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.

Kindle Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
Kindle My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
Kindle Fire for kids We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
Kindle is great Would be lost without my kindle and kindle unlimited spend lots of time reading
kindle kids fire it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
Kindles rock My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.
"Liked it so much I bought two! Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games."
"Looks good Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"

"Love it! My kids enjoy this tablet, as do I! The only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.Also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken."
Love it! Pros: preloaded with everything your kids will need.Cons: need to buy at least 32GB microSD with it.

Loyal customer Always content with best buy and their products. I would definitely recommend.
"Made my Christmas Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service....."
Maybe better for younger kids Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!
"Mom review, no techie stuff. I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me."
My 2 yr old granddaughter loves it. My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it.
My 3 year old loves it! I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.

My baby loves it I bought this as a Christmas gift for my toddler and she loves it.
"My daughter likes it At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
My daughters christmas gift. I never have any issues with this company or products!

My kids love it Awesome tablet for young children. They love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it.
"My kids love these These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
My little girl loves her tablet The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
"My nieces love it This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price."
My son didn't like it It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.
My son loves it He loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.
My son loves it i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe
"My son loves it I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though."
"my son loves it It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
My son loves it My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
My son loves it! My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.
my special needs daughter loves it My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter
My toddler loves it! My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.
My two year old loves this tablet This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
needs an account The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
Neice loves it I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.
Nice Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....
Nice 4 kids Nice for kids. Like the free apps built in the device. Can control what and how long they get to use screen time
Nice for kids Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it
Nice for the kids in the car Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
nice little tablet 4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
Nice little tablet Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.
Nice little tablet I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
Nice product A great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who likes ti play games and read books.
"Nice size I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone."
Nice tablet Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
"Nice tablet for a kid Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own."
"Nice tablet for a youngster My granddaughter really likes it. ""She"" found age-appropriate games to play."
Nice tablet for a youngster My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.
Nice tablet for children The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
"Nice tablet for kids, case is great protection Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case"
Nice tablet for my little girl i always buy from best buy. they have excellent products.The workers are very knowledgeable of what they sell.Thanks
Nice tablrt This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild
"Nice to have when on the go I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
Not as good as I'd hoped I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
Not as happy as I thought The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.
"not bad Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though"
Not bad Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
Not bad overall Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
"Not enough storage Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working."
Not for kids This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.
"Not for overseas! I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!"
Not good Picture quality is not good. I don't like this product
"not good this item is not good ok ...no use for my kids ,,,"
Not great tablet Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
Not impressed Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
Not just a toy Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
Not kid friendly I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.
not kid friendly When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
Not meet needs Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
Not much useful I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.
Not so bad for a child Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy
"Not sure I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son."
Not the best specs but not bad for the price My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.
"Not what I was looking for I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
Ok tablet for kids I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
"Okay Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
"Okay Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........"
Okay. Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
On Fire A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!
Our kid loves it. Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
Outstanding tablet for toddlers This tablet has been a great learning tool for my child.
"Perfect Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it."
"Perfect ""laptop"" for a preschooler The guy at the store was really helpful. There was not a pink Fire Kids Edition so he looked on top of all the shelves and found one. My four year old grand daughter loves it."
"Perfect entertainment for my young great grandson. This was perfect for entertaining my 20-month old great grandson during car trips, shopping and bedtime."
"Perfect first tablet for toddler With a great child-proof case, this was the perfect tablet to start my little guy off with!"
Perfect for 8 yr old This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps!
Perfect for a 2 yr old the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy
Perfect for a 7 year old boy! I bought this for my son's 7th birthday and he loves it!
Perfect for a toddler I bought this for my toddler and its perfect. He is rough with it and it still works. I wanted something that I use to teach him the basics of using a tablet and this worked great. It comes with a 2 yrs warranty.
Perfect for a toddler I have a 3 year old at home. Best purchase ever! Indestructible. Reliable. Easy to program. I would highly recommend this.
"Perfect for all ages So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine."
perfect for clumsy kids my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!
"Perfect for kids Can be dropped, thrown and doesnt break. awesome tablet"
Perfect for kids I love this tablet. It's durable and my niece loves it
"Perfect for kids My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well"
"Perfect for kids Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
Perfect for kids The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls
Perfect for kids! I like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. It has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .
Perfect for Kids!! purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
"Perfect for little kids Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books."
Perfect for little ones It's all the great features of the Fire but with added bonuses for the kids. The app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.
Perfect for little ones. Our children tend to forget to get gentle with the kindle so the replacement plan is great. And I don't have to worry about the wrong kind of content popping up. It's a relief.
"Perfect for Little Techies! My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
Perfect for my 3 year old My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.
Perfect for my 4 year old Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.
Perfect for my 8 year old! I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.
Perfect for my grandaughter Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1
Perfect for my grandbabies These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.
Perfect for my granddaughter I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.
Perfect for my grandson Leapfrog is a great learning tool for preschoolers and beyond my grandson loves it
Perfect for my Grandson Perfect for my grandson I love the easy to use set up and parental control. I have recommended this to my friend for her children. Case is great
Perfect for my young kids. This has the all speed and storage I needed for my first grader. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
Perfect for occupying toddler We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.
"Perfect for our toddler The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows"
"Perfect for preschooler Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them."
Perfect for the kids I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.
"PERFECT FOR THE PURPOSE I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee."
"Perfect for toddler I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all."
Perfect for toddlers This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.
"Perfect for youngsters My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands."
"Perfect gift Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself"
Perfect gift I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.
Perfect gift My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.
"Perfect Gift for kids I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it."
"Perfect kid tablet Got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! Lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. What really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that Amazon offers!"
"Perfect tablet and features for a child I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied."
"Perfect tablet for kids The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids."
"Perfect tablet for my kids, nephew and nieces. I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids."
"Perfect tablet for my kids, nieces and nephew This tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. It has lots of fun apps for the kids."
"Perfect tablet for the Littles Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
Perfect! I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.
PERFECT!! My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.
"piece of junk I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help."
Playtime for hours Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.
"Pretty darn decent! My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"Pretty good piece of equipment for the kiddos My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
"Pretty solid for the price Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
"Processor is slow My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version."
Product Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
Product Issues This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
Product Made for Kids and Adults alike I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.
"Purchased for my daughter This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus"
"Really great Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
Reasonably priced Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
"Recommend for 4-8yr olds. Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
Save your money This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
she loves it she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
"She loves it! I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
Should be great for grand daughter Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
Simple to use A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops
"Slow but good for kids Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls"
Slow performance Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
"So disappointed doesn't play Netflix So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all..."
"So far so good It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
"So far so good Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer."
"So far, so good! Bought this for a 2 year old. She loves it! She's already got more things figured out on it than I do!. Good educational programs and some fun ones too!"
So so You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
"Solid product Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The 'excited factor' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either."
Son is happy My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome
Son loves his tablet My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
Son loves it Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
Son loves it Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.
"Son loves it! Helps keep my son entertained on long rides, and it's pretty indestructible."
Son loves this tablet Great purchase for my son's 6th birthday. He love it and the kid account is a great addition
"Son's first tablet My two year old loves the videos,games and books this tablet provides."
"Sturdy Tablet I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long."
Sturdy tablet My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!
Such a great purchase Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
"Super easy to use kid's tablet This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling."
super learning tool kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there
Super slow It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
Switched from Samsung Galaxy Tablet to Fire Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.
tablet nice and easy-to-use for a 3 yr old ..............
Tablet Tablet works pretty good. I purchased it since I was a to make two accounts. One for myself and one for my child. Goo buy!!
Tablet The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.
"tablet fever I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet"
Tablet for a small child This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.
Tablet for children I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
Tablet for children It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device
Tablet for kid Gift for great nephew. Have 2 that are 5 and 6 y/o. Both love these tablets because each got one. Play with them as much as Mom allows.
Tablet for kid Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.
"Tablet for kids Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift."
"Tablet for my 8 year old Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
Tablet not for kids Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
Teresa This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!
The baby loves it ‚ù§ This tablet has great storage capacity. I have downloaded all kinds of children's movies and learning activities. It's great.
The best tablet for kids My 3yr. old loves this tablet. Easy for her to use. She watches videos plays games.
The camera and Cover are great Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.
The case it's great for kids Its a good product and also you can be monitoring what can your kids see
"The Grandkids LOVE It!!! The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better!"
The great tablet for children. We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.
"The kids LOVE it! :) My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away."
"The perfect tablet for kids. My daugther used to have a leap frog tablet, but when it started to have battery issues I went to the store and found out that they no longer produced the tablet, so best buy gave me store credit and they recomended me this tablet. My daugther loves it and so do I. On kidz mode I can rest assured that she is only going to see kids safe content like interactive book, games and apps. On tablet mode she can watch movies with the SD card slot which can go all they way to 128GB!I put a 32 GB which help us on our loooong christmas trip..."
"The tablet not so great as mentioned The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
"This is a great next step tablet for kids. My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case."
"This is a great product..easy to to use.... Bought for my 2 year old granddaughter l, she loves it, so easy to use .. She can navigate through it with no problems"
This is a great tablet for kids I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new.
This is great This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.
"This tablet is great for my child. My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it."
"This was a good investment for my grandson. I bought the Tablet for my grandson for Christmas. It was the best investment that I have made in all time. He is learning so much that he can't put it down. As a matter of fact, he sleeps this it just about every night."
This was an excellent choice for a 3 year old I purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter after having purchased her older sister one last year when she was 3. It's comforting knowing it has as durable cover to endure the energy of a toddler.
Too many pop up ads We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
Touch response is not good Touch response is not so good. so my kid refused to play games on this.Returned this product. Thanks to Bestbuy for the full refund
User friendly It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!
"User friendly, easy set up My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading"
"Very awesome! So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!"
Very child friendly. Glad that I get to control the time spent on which sure site and apps.
Very disappointed It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on
"Very durable Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
very durable works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet
very easy to use and is very durable. Grandkids fight over this. My daughter also uses this. Very good and user friendly. Would buy again.
Very educational Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it
Very good Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.
Very good The service was great and the help I received thanks
Very good resolution My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.
"Very good tablet for 8 year old Grandson has loved this since he opened it for his Birthday He was able to use it,figure it out, right away The protective case actually makes it easier for him to handle. Simple to set up for his home internet and parents were able to view and set up controls of their choice."
"very good value Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads"
Very happy So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
Very Happy Granddaughter This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
Very happy with the kindle fire Love how easy it is for my 9 year old sone to navigate around. The unlimited kindle free time is great too we like that we are able to set time limits as well as only allow age appropriate games and content. Our son Not only loves playing Minecraft and watching netflix on it but enjoys the reading the books as well.
Very interactive This was a gift to my niece. Her mom liked the parental controls
Very nice Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!
Very nice! We purchased this as a gift and the feedback we have received has been great.
"Very slow Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality"
Wait till it goes on sale. There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
"Well constructed This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!"
Well priced tablet for kids The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
"Well protected for kids It's really a good product to buy for kids. A lot of educational games . They can their favorite kids show from youtube, Netflix etc. The cover is really good. I'm gonna another one for my daughter."
Well worth the purchase May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained.
Will keep kids busy Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
Wonderful Great-----------------------------------------------
Wonderful I'm very with this kids friendly tablet. My daughter she uses my iPad and I decided to look one perfect for her...two years warrantee.
Wonderful My grandson loves it. Will be getting another one.
Wonderful BC starter tablet I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding
Wonderful for kids Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!
"Wonderful for my granddaughter My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it."
"Wonderful Item for Kids This is a great tablet for kids. Keeps them busy with so much to do, watch, and create."
Wonderful tablet for any age. Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.
"Works good this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it"
"Works great Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty."
Works great my grandson loves it Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues
"Works great, glad we bought it. Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device"
Works well I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
"Works well and kid friendly I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."
Works well. Grandson picked it up & used it right away. He enjoys the tablet.
works wonders for my son my son has been using our computer and we got him this and he never looked back.
"Worth it I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product."
"Wouldn't buy any other brand I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it."
"Wow! What a deal! Such a great deal for a small fee, just right for a toddler of three."
Yes I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids
Yes This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
"You pay for what you get This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far."
". Nice hand sized tablet While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
2nd purchase I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.
3rd time is the charm I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.
"5 star service bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier."
7 year old granddaughter loves it This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
"8"" fire 16gb tablet I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)"
"A big step up from Fire HD7 Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great."
A cheap tablet I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
A gift She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
"A gift for Grandma A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing."
"A gift for my wife, and now I'm jealous! Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday..."
a Good buy The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
"A good buy! This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped."
"A good improvement over previous models My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
a good tablet I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well
A good value The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
A great buy I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!
A great gift! My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.
"A great replacement tablet My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!"
A great starter tablet for a youngster Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
"A Great Tablet for a Great Price This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!"
"A great tablet for the price I've owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn't disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don't expect it to be a top of the line tablet."
"A little hard to use Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
A lot for a little Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed.
"A Lot of Bang for the Buck! I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!"
"A MUST if you have Amazon Prime I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
"A nice Kindle Reader A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
"A nice upgrade to my old kindle. I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
A perfect gift for grandkids!! Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
"A Solid Basic Tablet I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
A very good deal I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
"Absolute love it Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!"
Absolutely great I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device .
Absolutely great! Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online.
"Adequate 8"" Tablet I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste."
"Adequate entry level tablet This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
"Ads ads and ads If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
Affordable Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems
"Affordable price for a tablet If you are using Amazon Prime, you definitely like this table as it can stream the video, audio, reading book... easy to carry with you"
Affordable quality Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.
"Affordable Tablet Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!"
All about the free play The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.
almost perfect this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
Always a good purchase This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal
Amazing I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.
Amazing I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!
Amazing deal! We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!
"Amazing for the price Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones"
Amazing product Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it
Amazing Size. Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
"Amazing tablet for the price I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up."
Amazing Tablet with an Amazing Price Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
"Amazing Tablet!! The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great."
Amazing! I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
amazon its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it.
Amazon Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 16gb - Wi-fi The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
"Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 16gb - Wi-fi - Bl Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere."
"Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8"" - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - T A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why."
amazon 8 inch 4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.
Amazon Fire I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.
Amazon Fire I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!!
Amazon fire I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
"Amazon Fire If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
amazon fire my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
"Amazon Fire 8HD It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it."
"Amazon Fire does what I need it for - great for me Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot."
"Amazon Fire HD I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it."
"Amazon Fire HD This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
"Amazon Fire HD 8 pad We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10"" version."
Amazon Fire Hd8 Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure
Amazon fire HD8 Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
Amazon fire tablet Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
"Amazon Fire Tablet GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation"
"amazon fire! Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!"
"Amazon HD 8 I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely."
"Amazon is amazing For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
Amazon is the best This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
Amazon Kindle FIRE hd-8 Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire.
"Amazon Lover I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
Amazon tablet Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
"An average Fire tablet Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
An easy & convenient device! This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!
An excellant product. This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
"An excellent E-reader I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life."
"Another great tablet If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
App options pathetic Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed
April love best buy Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy

Awesome Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price
Awesome Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution
Awesome I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.
Awesome I have been using this for a bit now. It's wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer.
Awesome I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
Awesome It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
Awesome Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account
"Awesome No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem"
Awesome Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints

"Awesome personal tablet Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed."
Awesome product Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages
Awesome product Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video.
"Awesome product, very light Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you."
"Awesome product! Amazing Price! My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working."
Awesome tab for the price. Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
Awesome Table I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.
"Awesome Table for the $$ Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices."
Awesome tablet Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix
"Awesome Tablet For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!"
Awesome tablet Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
Awesome tablet Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
Awesome Tablet Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat.
Awesome Tablet I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price
"Awesome Tablet Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet."
"Awesome tablet Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far."
Awesome tablet Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
Awesome tablet So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too.
Awesome tablet Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone.
"Awesome Tablet This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend."
"Awesome tablet This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all!"
Awesome tablet Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly
Awesome tablet for a good price Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse
Awesome tablet for a small fee. If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
Awesome tablet for kids Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad
Awesome tablet for my nephew My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.
Awesome tablet only one flaw Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it's a grade little tablet!
Awesome tablet! Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!
Awesome tablet!! Like this so much bought another one for my daughter.
Awesome tablet!! The granddaughter loves it and she can't put it down.
"Awesome tablet. Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games!"
Awesome tablet. I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating.
Awesome tablet/reader Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.
Awesome to use LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
"awesome, convenient bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for"
Awesome! This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!
Awesome!value for money Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.
"Awsome Tablet Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults."
"Awsome Tablet and great price Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos."
"Bang for the buck . . . If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
"Bargain tablet Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
basic kindle upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
basic tablet I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
"Battery life is awesome! I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift."
Beautiful Tablet This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
"Beginner tablet for our 9 year old son. Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
"Beginner to Tablets I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
"Best Amazon Tablet Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa."
best at it price very good product in its price range affordable and very good
Best bang for the buck ! We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
"Best bang for your buck This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds."
"Best bang for your buck! Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing."
Best Bang For Your Money Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
"Best budget tablet I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
Best budget tablet period This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price.
"Best buy for the kids ever! I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
Best buy for the kids! One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
"Best Buy for your buck I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
"Best Buy, literally This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it's worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:)"
"Best companion for Amazon users I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance."
Best deal Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.
"Best deal on a reader tablet I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader."
"Best Decision I Ever Made This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user."
"Best ever , I went back and bought one more.. It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast.."
Best gift for Beginers Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.
Best gift we bought this year! Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
"Best Kindle owned This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
Best Kindle to date Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
"Best Kindle Yet Bigger screen, longer battery life and faster loading...an improvement over the last model and a great choice if this is your first tablet. As a college student, it beats spending more on books and having to lug the extra weight on my back"
Best one to date! This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
"Best portable Netflix device ever Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything"
"Best price Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc"
"Best product for this price range Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
Best purchase ever So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it
Best Quality Tablet Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school.
"Best tablet backed by Amazon The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
"Best Tablet Choice Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
"Best tablet ever I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids."
Best tablet for its price the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os
Best tablet for price I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
Best tablet for reading. I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn't hurt his eyes like the iPad.
"Best tablet for the money HD 8"" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included."
Best tablet for the price I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.
Best tablet for under 200$ I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
"Best Tablet under $100 This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
Best value for a tablet Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
"Better than ever Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it."
Better than the kindle fire 6 Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.
Better than the Kindle HD 7 Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
bigger screen! Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!
Birthday gift Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
"Birthday Present My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did."
"Black Friday Deal Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device."
"Bought 2 Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night."
Bought as a gift Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
Bought as a Gift Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .
Bought as a replacement Better then the older models bigger and better then before
Bought for 5 year old. Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
"Bought for a friend, he loves it. I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names."
"Bought for a gift Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
"Bought for daughter Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
Bought for grandkids they love it Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it
"Bought for Kindle Reading and Amazon prime First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions."
"Bought for Senior and Preteen I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
Bought it for my son I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot
Bought this for Wife. She loves it Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again!
Bought two of these. Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps.
"Brings hours of enjoyment. Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon."
Broke in 5 mos I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
Budget priced and Easy to use This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
"Burned by fire I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
Came mostly set up. Easy to use. Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.
Can be slow I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I've had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job.
can download audio books it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.
"Can't beat if for the price What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
"Can't beat it! This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
Can't go wrong These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.
"Capable tablet at a bargain price. Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
CHEAP OPTƒ∞ON ƒ∞t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
cheap tablet and great excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance
Christmas gift Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.
Christmas gift Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it.
Christmas Gift I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
Christmas gift This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.
"Christmas gift This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!"
Christmas gift for hubby. I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.
"Christmas gift for my daughter She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
Christmas gift for wife Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
Christmas gifts Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update
Christmas present Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
Christmas present my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
"Christmas present This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
Christmas Purchase Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.
Clear & crisp! Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
"Color difference is HUGE. Bad customer service. I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
"Compact computer Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer"
Computer in my palm I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
Convenient to carry around Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
cool device i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system
Cool product Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
corporate consultant great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
Couldn't be happier w/ Amazon Fire HD Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!
Daughter loves it Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!!
Daughter loves it Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
"Daughter's new Kindle Fire HD8 My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled."
dead This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
decent beginner tablet I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs .
Decent tablet good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
"Decent Tablet Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work."
Decent tablet We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
"Decent Tablet - For the price Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
"Decent tablet but not high caliber The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
Decent Tablet for Teen Basic Games This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
"Decent.... Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well..."
"Disappointed Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight."
"Disappointed I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
Disappointed no access to Apps without credit card Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
"Disappointed with device, Mfg, and seller I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
Does everything I need My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast.
Does the job Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
Doesn't stay on I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
"Dual Use I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
Ease in use I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn't have with my old kindle.
Ease of use Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
"Easy Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it."
"Easy and Convenient This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
"Easy and intuitive It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it"
Easy Peasy Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.
Easy play Apps Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
easy set up and user friendly suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion
Easy tablet to use I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further.
"Easy to learn to use its many features. Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
easy to navigate and nice size for travel This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.
"Easy to operate and read. Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read."
"easy to operatedownloaded alot of books love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone"
"Easy to read, but loses charge fast I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
"EASY TO SET UP AND USE BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"
easy to use Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great
Easy to use Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!
Easy to use Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can't beat the price!

Easy to Use The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
Easy to use This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids
Easy to use This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues
Easy to use This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere.
Easy to Use We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.
"Easy to use We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well......"
"Easy to use We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group."
easy to use and enjoy exploring what it would do still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size.
Easy to use especially if you are a prime member. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it.
Easy to use tablet Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.
"Easy to use, economical My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!"
"Easy to use, with good, clear screen display. This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
easy to use; a little heavy to hold enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining
"Easy to use; minimal set-up needed My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
Easy to use. Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift.
Easy to use. Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
"Easy to use. I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
"Easy to watch movies, play games and read books it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
Easy to watch videos I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
Easy to work Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly
Easy use This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
Easy use. Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
Ended up returning I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
"Enjoy I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer."
Enjoy it Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games
Enjoyable This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.
"Enjoyable Tablet I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!"
Enjoyed Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling.
Enjoying my new tablet I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.
Enter than I thought Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
"Equal to the other tablet (ipad) I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok"
"Even better than before I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
"even better than the old Kindle Fire this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I'm not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more."
even my 70 year old mom can use it! purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
Everything good you expected Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
Everything we needed Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
Everything you expect Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
"Everything you expect from Amazon This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
exactly what I was looking for exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up
"Exceeds my expectations I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
"Excelent Tablet I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."
Excelent tablet for my child It's easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot
excellebt tablet this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
Excellect Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders
Excellect purchase The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy.
Excellent As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose
Excellent Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.
"Excellent I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails."
Excellent I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.
Excellent I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know
"Excellent Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework"
"excellent like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader."
"Excellent My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best."
excellent the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time
Excellent Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work.
"Excellent -- purchased for door prize Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ)."
Excellent Amazing HD 8 Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.
Excellent basic tablet This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech.
Excellent budget tablet Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire.
Excellent buy for kids We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
Excellent Buy! I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price.
Excellent buy! Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!
"Excellent Device bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied."
Excellent fire tab I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend
"Excellent for children I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor"
"Excellent for it's price point. I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat."
Excellent for price For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
Excellent for reading Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time
Excellent for simple games and social media. I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
Excellent for the money Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.
"Excellent for the price paid I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use."
Excellent Functionality & Value The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
"Excellent gift I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it."
"Excellent gift for kids This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
"Excellent HD8 16GB Tablet I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
Excellent I pad Easy to use and great value. Excellent viewing with good color
"Excellent Kindle Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot."
"excellent low price tablet I'm not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more."
"Excellent Price Point. I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase."
"Excellent product Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
Excellent Product Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
Excellent product I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
"Excellent Product I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
"Excellent Product I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!"
Excellent product at a very reasonable price. This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.
Excellent product for the price This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It's very responsive and the screen resolution is great.
"Excellent reader Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
Excellent reader Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading...
Excellent reader Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
Excellent size The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
"Excellent tablet great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products."
"Excellent tablet I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet"
"Excellent tablet I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far."
Excellent tablet I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.
Excellent Tablet The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
"Excellent Tablet Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8"" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended."
Excellent tablet at great price. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
Excellent tablet for a gift I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.
"Excellent tablet for email, Facebook and media. I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied."
"Excellent Tablet for Entertaiment This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
"Excellent tablet for games, reading, email, photos Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations."
"Excellent tablet for moderate use at a great price I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too."
"Excellent tablet for my kids. I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
"Excellent tablet for the family I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster."
Excellent tablet for the low price The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable.
"Excellent tablet for the money Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
"Excellent Tablet for the money Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
"Excellent tablet for the money Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend."
Excellent tablet for the money With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
Excellent tablet for the price I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
"Excellent tablet for the price! On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!"
Excellent tablet! Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.
Excellent tablet! ! Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.
Excellent value For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube
"Excellent value I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but I don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value."
"Excellent value It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
"Excellent value Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value."
"Excellent Value Upgraded from a6"" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don't think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size."
"Excellent, inexpensive tablet Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
"Excellent!!! Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
Exceptional Tablet The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!
"Exchanged for the 10' The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift,"
Extremely good value !!!! The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.
"Extremely Happy I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating."
fabulous! I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
"Fan of Amazon fire With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
"Fantastic Buy! I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions."
"Fantastic for light internet access. Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet."
"fantastic purchase bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this."
Fantastic purchase My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
"Fantastic so nice bought it 3x I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!"
"Fantastic Tablet for kids I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
"Fantastic Tablet for the price This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
Fantastic tablet for the price! My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon!
Far exceeded my expectations First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
Fast and reliable This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures!
"Fast but screen not as big as ipad mini Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
Fast Tablet This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
"Favorite of any tablet The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
"Fine for reading Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
"Fine tablet It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side."
"fire good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time"
Fire The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
Fire We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.
Fire 2 Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
Fire 8 HD I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
Fire 8 hd I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
"Fire 8 talbet Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life"
Fire HD I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues.
Fire HD I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
"Fire HD This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended."
Fire hd We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
Fire HD 8 Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member.
Fire HD 8 I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product.
"fire hd 8 seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1"
Fire HD 8 The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
"Fire HD 8 Color Orange The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
"fire hd 8 nice screen The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets."
"Fire Hd 8 tablet Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but"
FIRE HD Amazing I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics.
"Fire HD tablets It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
"Fire HD8 Tablet I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
fire hd8 tablet Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.
fire tablet I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
"Fire Tablet Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming."
Fire Tablet Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
"Fire Tablet - great for entertainment I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
"Fire works for me Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
"Fire_HD The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
"FireHD 8 The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great."
First Amazon FIRE Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
First experience with technology First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it.
First one Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great
First tablet I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot.
"First Tablet. Lots of possibilities. Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
"Fit my need I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don't need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well."
For a friend She says this was the best gift she ever received.
"For a toddler!! purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!"
"For my 3 Yr Old Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned...."
"For the little ones Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
For the money it can't be beat as a tablet. Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.
"For the price...and Alexa This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!."
For wife - likes it Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
Found what I needed. Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
"Free Tablet Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
frustrating compared to an android Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
"Fun adult toy Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle."
Fun for kids Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
Fun tablet I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
Fun tablet for anyone This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
"Fun to play with. If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets."
"Geart tablet My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great"
Geeat tablet Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it
"Get Online without Hassle Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media."
"Gets the job done I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty."
"Gets the job done very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
"Gets the work done I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
Gift I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.
Gift Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
Gift Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books.
Gift Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.
Gift Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.
"gift This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price."
Gift This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..
"Gift for 99 year old This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook"
Gift for a Marine Bought for our son so he wouldn't have to carry books back from his deployment
"Gift for Mother In Law This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!"
Gift for my dad. Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
"Gift for my granddaughter I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!"
Gift for relative. My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.
"Gifted this tablet to my Dad My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
Good A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.
"Good About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good"
good blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you
good bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
Good Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading
Good I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear.
"Good I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle."

good nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
Good One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely!
Good This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
Good affordable tablet You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
Good Alexa device Needed an¬†inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
"Good android tablet Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
Good Back Up Tablet For what it does it's great for me a good alternative
Good bargain tablet Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
Good basic protection Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend
Good basic tablet It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
good basic tablet and excellent price Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
"Good battery We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
Good Beginner's Tablet Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
"Good budget tablet It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
"Good budget tablet It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
Good but could be better This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.
Good but... At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
Good buy Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.
Good buy Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
Good Buy Great product for surfing the internet or reading books!
Good Buy I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
Good buy Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.
"Good buy at BestBuy Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email."
Good buy for a child or novice user Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles
Good buy for the money I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
"Good buy for the price I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
Good Buy! The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
"Good cheap tablet Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot."
Good cheap tablet This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music.
Good choice for my kids This is a very good product my kids do homework on it
"Good deal Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
Good Deal Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
"Good device I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit."
Good device for beginners I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
Good device. I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights
"Good family tablet Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed."
Good for a child I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
Good for beginners I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
"Good for games and books The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money."
good for its range its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
"Good for kids Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
"Good for Kids I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
Good for kids I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
Good for Kids This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
Good for price Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
Good for price Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.
Good for price Great graphics for price compared to other brands.
good for price It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.
good for price ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
Good for price. I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
"Good for reading I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
"Good for reading and audio books. I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price."
Good for smart kids Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work.
Good for the books. Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
"Good for the grandkids I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!"
"Good for the mind Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books."
"Good for the money Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable...."
Good for the money Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
Good for the price Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
"Good for the price I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
Good for the price It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
"Good for the price It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
"Good for the price Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
Good for the price Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage.
Good for the price Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
Good for the price So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
"good for the price This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
"Good for what I use it for I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
Good for what I use it for It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
good for Wifi finatic kids I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
"Good gift Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
Good graphics and very easy to use I'd recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use.
"Good hardware, bad software The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
"Good ipad alternative Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
"Good IPAD alternative Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge..."
Good item. The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.
"Good lightweight Tablet I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
"Good little tablet with HD quality I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features."
Good low budget Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
"Good low cost option for tablet Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
"good low cost tablet for basic surfing and email Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I'm a fan of Silk, but it works well enough."
Good low level tablet good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
Good media consumption device Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.
"Good Option Among Value Tablets I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old."
Good overall tablet This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
Good parental controls for a 5 year old. Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
"good portable device my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use"
Good Price Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
good price For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
"Good Price For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
"good price This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine."
"Good price Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great!"
"good price for the tablet the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
Good price. This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.
good product Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
Good product Good product with best price available in the market place
Good product Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
Good product I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
Good product I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile
Good product I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
Good product It was great product. the price which I got it was great.
Good product This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.
"Good Product at a Great Purchase Price Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don't like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory."
Good product for price Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
good product for the money Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
Good Product. Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
"Good Purchase I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc."
good quality for school Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
"good quality of all apps My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
Good reader I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ‚Äãis a very functional and easy to use.
"Good Reader with Internet benefits I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
Good Replacement for Ipad One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
"Good size Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer"
"Good size We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
Good starter tablet Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
Good stuff Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far.
Good tablet Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it
Good Tablet Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for.
"good tablet Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits."
good tablet Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
"Good tablet Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
Good tablet Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
Good tablet Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.
Good tablet Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it
"Good tablet Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
"Good Tablet Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
Good tablet Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books.
good tablet I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.
Good Tablet My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.
"Good tablet Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use."
good tablet performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
Good tablet Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
Good tablet So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
Good tablet Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
Good tablet The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
"Good tablet This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
Good tablet This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal.
"Good Tablet We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value."
good tablet We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.
Good tablet Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
"Good tablet and was very skeptical, great choice We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids."
Good tablet at a great price. If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
"Good tablet for a good price I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use."
"Good tablet for a senior. Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games."
Good tablet for basic needs Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
"Good tablet for basic use. The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
"Good Tablet for Books Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
"Good tablet for browsing, streaming, reading Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
Good tablet for children I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more.
Good tablet for great price Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet.
"Good tablet for kids Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost"
"Good tablet for kids It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps"
"Good tablet for reading and watching videos I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
Good tablet for the money Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
good tablet for the money it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet
"Good tablet for the money My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
Good Tablet for the Price Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product.
"Good tablet for the price I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
good tablet for the price. this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
"Good tablet for the price. This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
"Good tablet for what it does Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
Good tablet for what it's designed to do Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
"Good Tablet, Good Value This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value."
"Good tablet, great battery life If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
"Good tablet! Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
"Good Tablet! Very happy with the Kindle tablet! Bought it to replace an old Kindle tablet. Great tablet, serves the purpose well. Basic browsing, netflix and amazon videos.Only issue is my older tablet had a mini hdmi not this one, so screen connect is only through Amazon echo.Still a good tablet!"
Good tablet. Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.
Good tablets for kids We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
Good Tool The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.
Good Tv Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
good upgrade from my old kindle Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
Good value Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.
Good value Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.
"Good value Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
Good Value I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
"Good Value Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading."
good value overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice
"Good value Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
"Good Value The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
"Good value This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle."
Good Value This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right.
"Good value Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa"
good value for kindle fire hd 8 Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful
Good value for money Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.
Good value for the price For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
"Good value for what you get First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus."
Good value tablet It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.
"Good, not great Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying."
Good!!! I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
"Good.... so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
Got as a gift Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?
Got for my wife Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down
Got it as a gift for my bf and he loves it! My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad!
Got the tablet for my grandson Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak
Got this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day.
Grand kids love it! I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download.
"great awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone"
"Great Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it."
great Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job
Great Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.
Great Great device very functional love it will recommend
Great Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.
"Great great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price"
Great Great products as usual and great customer service
Great Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
Great Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do.
Great I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it
Great I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her
great I like this and the price is right enjoying it now
Great I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.
Great I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
Great I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one
Great It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it.
Great It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.
Great It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web
Great It's works really well and don't have any issues at all
Great Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
Great Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don't have a tablet or never used one
Great Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
Great My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school.
Great My wife got this for her Kindle books so she can read on the go
Great My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase.
Great Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.
"Great Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight."
"Great Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for."
great The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
"Great The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
great This is a very responsive device for the amount paid
Great This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.
Great Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
great Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
"Great 8"" tablet!! Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
"Great addition I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
Great addition with camera and Alexa This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad.
"Great Alternative to College Textbooks I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
"Great alternative to expensive tablets I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product."
Great alternative to iPad Mini Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members
"Great Amazon tablet I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
"Great Amazon Tablet It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
Great Amazon tablet works for me . This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it.
"Great and easy to use I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!"
Great and light weight!! Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
Great and lightweight reader I love ordering books and reading them with the reader.
Great and versatile Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
"Great android tablet With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time."
"Great as a tablet and E-reader Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
Great as an e-reader Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.
Great as ereader I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
"Great Bang for the Buck Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
Great bang for your buck Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.
"Great bargain Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
"Great bargain tablet Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price."
Great Bargain Tablet I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet.
"Great bargain tablet. Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!"
Great basic kindle Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
Great basic tab Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
Great basic tablet This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
"Great basic tablet, best with Prime subscription Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
"Great Battery Life So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone's battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :)"
Great Beginner Tablet Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job's Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books.
Great beginners tablet My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
"Great black friday price for this tablet I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
"great book reader this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range"
Great Book Reader with lots of extra features Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use
Great budget tablet Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
Great budget tablet Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
Great budget tablet Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.
Great budget tablet The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7.
"Great Budget Tablet This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
Great budget tablet This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
"Great but alone Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun."
Great buy Best bang for your buck............................
Great buy Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great Buy Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday
Great Buy I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.
GREAT BUY I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE!
"Great Buy i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics"
"Great Buy I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
"Great buy If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else."
Great Buy Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.
Great buy My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.
"Great buy Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
"Great Buy Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue."
great buy and easy to use I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use.
GREAT BUY FOR MY GRANDSON I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
"Great buy for the price Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price."
Great buy for the price Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy!
"Great buy for the price! I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet!"
"Great buy, nice screen resolution I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad."
Great buy! Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus
Great buy! I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it!
"Great buy! I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7"" for my wife that afternoon!"
Great buy! I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.
"Great buy! It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating."
Great buy! This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.
Great buy!! Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I'm very happy with this purchase!
"Great cable, esp. for price Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone ""barrows"" a cable."
Great cheap purchase This is the first tablet i have owned and i must say it runs great. And the battery lasts for a good amount of time. Cant complain when it comes that cheap.
Great Children Tablets They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
Great children's apps for free. Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks.
"great Christmas gift Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it."
Great Christmas Gift We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
great compact tablet great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity
Great deal Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet
Great deal Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.
"Great deal on a great tablet This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered."
Great deal thanks I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
Great deal! I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.
Great Device Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
"Great Device Better then a E-book, more options and versatility"
"Great Device Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break."
Great Device Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews.
Great device I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
Great device I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
Great device This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
"Great device This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!"
Great device This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has
Great device for my sons games This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
"Great device for the price Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload."
Great device for viewing video and books Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
"Great Device for What It Is Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
Great Device! I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
Great e reader I've had kindles since they first came out love it
Great e-reader Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet.
"Great E-reader This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
"Great e-reader and basic color tablet Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable."
"great e-reader tablet Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
"Great e-reader! Easy to load, works with our local library (borrow books for free)."
Great e-reader. Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
"great ebook the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended"
Great ebook reader Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
"Great Ebook reader I recieved this as a present for my birthday, so far it has been great. I have bought several books and it makes a great Ebook reader."
"Great entry level tablet If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!"
"Great entry tablet for the price Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps."
Great ereader I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.
"Great eReader This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to."
Great ereader + This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.
"Great ereader and tablet I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
Great every day tablet This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
Great everyday tablet!! Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
"Great features and affordable I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!"
"Great features! The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
great fire amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
Great fire tablet Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.
Great first tablet Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.
Great first tablet! This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!
"Great Fitness Watch This watch is not only very useful, it's very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the ""smartwatch"" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least."
great for a beginner Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
Great for a first time user It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on
"Great for a small tablet Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference."
"Great for Amazon-related activities I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned."
Great for an ereader This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.
great for any age love it It is very handy great when i don't want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere
Great for anyone! I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy!
Great for anyone. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
"Great For Basic To Moderate Use I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
"Great For Basics This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet."

"Great for consuming content This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
great for e reader and email I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.
"Great for entertainment Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."

The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."

"Great for reading I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd."

"Great for the Grandkids Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved ."

great for the money I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.
Great for the new user. Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
"Great for the price At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
Great for the price Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good.
"great for the price great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either"
Great for the price I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
great for the price I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
"great for the price I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
Great for the price Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
Great for the price No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
"Great for the Price The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
Great for the price This is a great little tablet for what you're paying for it! Gets everything done that I need it to

"Great for young teens & adults Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read."
"Great fun,Educational apps,books,brain teasers Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
Great gadget for kids I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children

"Great gift I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!"
Great gift My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life

Great gift This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers!
Great gift for college graduate I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it.
Great gift for electronically challenged adults. I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad.
Great gift for kids I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.
"Great gift for my grandson Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can't wait until he opens it"

Great gift idea Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family.
"Great gift idea. $69....well worth it I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it!"
Great gift! Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages.
"Great Gift! I got an 8"" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift."

"Great inexpensive tablet Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again."
"Great inexpensive tablet Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."
"Great inexpensive tablet This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size."
Great Inexpensive Tablet This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend
"Great interface, great screen for reading Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from."
Great intro tablet Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
Great investment I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
"Great ipad for a beginner such as I am It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
Great item Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!

"Great Kindle I love to read! Books,books, books and more books."
Great Kindle I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch.

Great little online browser for the price I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.
Great little reader It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.
"Great Little Tablet I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
"Great little tablet It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
Great little Tablet Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !
Great little tablet This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.

Great pad Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.
Great Pad but still not the best The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.

It's processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it's very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price."
"Great performance for the price! Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price."
"Great performer Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price."

Great tablet We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends
"Great tablet We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better."
"Great Tablet works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos"
"Great tablet works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle"
Great Tablet You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
"Great tablet all around Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity."
"Great tablet and great price! I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I've enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas."
"Great tablet and not expensive I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for."
"great tablet and price I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8"" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too."
"Great tablet at a good price Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot."
Great tablet at a great price Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal.
Great tablet at a great price This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
Great tablet at a great price! Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
Great tablet compared to a small phone screen The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.

"Great tablet for kids! We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
Great tablet for me I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.

Great tablet for price Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.

Great tablet for someone who can't afford a IPad I was always an IPad person but after having this I'm fine with it. It's easy to use and inexpensive.
Great tablet for speed I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
great tablet for teenagers Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody.
"Great tablet for the $ I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price."

I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet.

Great tablet for the price It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
Great tablet for the price Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
"great tablet for the price My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."

great tablet for the price Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!
"Great tablet for the price The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
"Great tablet for the price The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it)."

"Great tablet for the price paid I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience."
"Great tablet for the price with good features/apps Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet."

"Great Tablet option on a Budget Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon's OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great."
"Great tablet to replace my nook I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook!"
Great tablet to start Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house.
great tablet very durable I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
"Great tablet with caveats I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."
"Great Tablet with Fire OS This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases!"
"Great tablet-reasonably priced I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks."

"Great tablet, only problem.. I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
"Great tablet, right size Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
"Great Tablet, unbelievable price I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!"

Great tablet. Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
"Great tablet. I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
Great tablet. I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
Great tablet. I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.
Great Tablet. Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies.

Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year."

Great to stream movies I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym
Great to travel with Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
Great to use on go Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
"Great to use with hand injury I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"
Great toy for kids My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted.
"Great travelTablet Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!"
"Great UI Experience The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task."
Great update I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb.
"Great updated Kindle I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
"Great upgrade I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
"Great upgrade Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia""."
Great Upgrade Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.
Great use of my dollars Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle
"Great Value Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
GREAT VALUE BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
Great Value Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
"Great Value Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
"Great value Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing."
"Great value I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations."
Great value I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.
"Great Value I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself."
Great Value It's a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy
"Great Value My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,."
GREAT VALUE PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.
great value serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
"Great Value Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores."
Great value The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad
GREAT VALUE The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
"Great value This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime."
Great Value Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
Great value Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
Great Value Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift
Great value Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds.
Great Value after additions Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
"Great value and well Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
Great value for price Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
Great value for pricing Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
Great value for the money. Fast processor as well Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.
Great value for the price I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.
Great value for the price... Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device!
"Great value for what you get It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
"Great value tablet!! Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
"Great value, performance for the price Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights."
great way to stay informed This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage
"Great working tablet for the price The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness."
"Great xmas gift My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time."
"Great, but awaiting Alexa feature Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
"Great, easy to use tablet Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
"Great, quality tablet Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
"Great, simple, and resonably priced tablet. Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend"
Great! Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
Great! Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it!
Great! Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!
Great! Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
Great! Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
Great! Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.
Great! This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
Great! Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
great! We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it.
"Great!! I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!!"
Great!!!! Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
"Great!!!! This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged."
Great. Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.
Great. Easy to set up and use! Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
Great. Simple easy to use Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag.
"greatest tablet at this price point great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
"Grest tablet Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around"
"Gret device This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc."
"Had one already, like it. Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild."
Handy Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
Handy and fun. I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
Happy My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use
Happy customer Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.
"happy with Amazon tablet very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
Happy with this purchase I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
"Hard to beat for the price! This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
"Hard to beat value Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead."
Hard to set up I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
"Has everything you need This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
Has potential. I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
"hate it not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
"Have a nook, this is better has more apps and go Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
Haven't set it up yet It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.
"HD Fire8 I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use."
Hd tablet This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
hey its a tablet great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
Hi Def is great and speed better than the past I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.
High performing tablet for good price The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.
"Hits the spot! This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price!"
"Ho-hum! It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person."
Husband's Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
I I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
I am a Kindle lover. This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it.
I am impressed with the Kindle Fire HD. The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
I am trying to know more about it. I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
I bought one for me and one for each of my nieces. I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
I bought the Kindle FireHD for a beginner I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.
I have 3 kindle fires I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
I have a new Kindle HD8 I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library.
I like I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
I like it I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
I like it! I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
I like my kindle fire This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.
I like the Kindle Fire very much. My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
I like the screen size and the camera. The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.
I love everything you can do on it. I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.
I love it I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
I love it Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price
"I love it! I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!"
"I Love It! The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn."
i love it!!! i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!
I love it. I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.
I love my Kindle The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
I love my Kindle! The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
"I love my kindle......best investment I have made I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
"I love my kindles I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc"
I love my new Kindle. It's better than I thought. This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all.
I love these Kindles so much My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them
I love this product and the fact that has an SD ca I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's
I love this product. I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.
I love this tablet! Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.
I LOVE this tablet. I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
"I love this thing. This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will."
"I think better than kindle paperweight This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
I use my Kindle every day. This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.
"I would buy it again I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
I'd buy again Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
I'd give it a 10 star rating! Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
I'm happy with it Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
"I'M NEW AT THIS I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
I'm very happy with my kindle hd8 I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
Images I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others
Impressive for kids A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
In love! I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
"In love! I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
"Incredible value tablet! Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road."
Inexpensive One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
"Inexpensive - works for me I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well."
"Inexpensive, yet Great quality tablet I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
"iPad ""lite"" This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there."
iPod nano I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.
Is a great gift for the kids. This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
"It fits my need perfectly My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
It Has Alexa Built In! Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
"It is a great product! The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
It is a great tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grand It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.
"It is a shopping device If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
It is amazing Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
It nice We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
It was a gift My grandson loves it . He was very happy with it .
It was a good buy It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
It was a present The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person!
It was purchased as a gift. My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.
"It works and charge well No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
It's a great item that I purchased as a Christmas. I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
It's all most people need Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
It's alright It's alright to browse the Internet and watch videos.
"It's an ok tablet, but very limited in apps. I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode."
It's easy to use My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
It's fair Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
It's fast and perfect I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better
It's great I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
"It's great, I love it! I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions."
It's neato It's nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug.
It's nice and whatever Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.
It's nice little tablet The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it
It's ok Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.
it's ok my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
"It's pretty average for what you are paying I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
Its a good small tablet This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
"Its an ok tablet. My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults."
Its great! Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it
"Its perfect for my 9 year old There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
"jealous I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one."
"Just as expected I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!"
Just as expected This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it's just as advertised.
Just fun for everyone. Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
Just ok It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
just right for me it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
Just the right price I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
"Just what I wanted I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
Just what she wanted This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great.
Keeps the wife happy and thus me as well Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.
"Kid Friendly My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
kid friendly Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
Kid loved it This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
Kids gift for Xmas She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
Kids love Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around.
"Kids love it It's a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too"
"kids love it Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate."
Kids present Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.
Kids tablet Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
killer tab. So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.
Kindle great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.
Kindle I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.
Kindle This is really nice and has great clarity I like it.
Kindle This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
"Kindle 8 I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
Kindle 8 16 GB Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it
"Kindle 8"" Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase."
Kindle baby This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours.
"Kindle Fire Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too."
Kindle Fire Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
Kindle Fire I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.
Kindle fire I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up!
Kindle fire Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.
"Kindle Fire My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect."
Kindle fire This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!
"KINDLE FIRE This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
Kindle Fire We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen.
Kindle fire 8 Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks
Kindle fire 8 Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
Kindle Fire 8HD I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!
"Kindle fire hd My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
"Kindle Fire HD 8 These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well."
Kindle Fire HD 8 This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
Kindle fire hd 8 great for everything internet . My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to
Kindle fire hd 8th generation I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
"Kindle Fire HD Just OK I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
Kindle Fire HD8 Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate.
Kindle Fire HD8 This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.
"Kindle fire hd8 This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
Kindle Fire HD8 This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I've bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options.
kindle fire hd8 2016 outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
kindle fire review I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!!
Kindle fire rocks Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
Kindle Fire tablet Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.
kindle hd love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.
"Kindle on fire!! Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with!"
"Kindle Reading I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books...."
Kindle to Fire I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
Kindle upgrade Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
"Kindle upgrade My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the ""shiny new toy"" is fun."
"Kindle with a lot of advertising I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
"Kindle/Amazon Fire I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!"
Kindles r best! Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can't bet this tablet for any price!
Late gift for my grandson Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).
less cumbersome This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
"Library in 8"" I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it"
light and compact i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
Lightweight and sleek For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
"Lightweight, easy to use tablet I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
"Like a laptop, only smaller I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
like it like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.
Like our Kindle Fire Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc√© downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
like product need some help w/questions I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
"Like the product I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc√©."
Like the size The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.

Love it I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.
"Love it I traded this in after receiving a 7"" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies.

"Love it My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games."
Love it My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
Love it Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.
Love it Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it.
Love it Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.

Love my fire I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;

Love my kindle I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one.
Love my kindle This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera.
Love my kindle Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids

"Love of games Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
Love reading wanted a smaller tablet for reading I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!
"Love the Amazon 8"" HD It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
Love the Amazon Fire Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.
"Love the Amazon Fire Hd8 I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time."
Love the apps. Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.
Love the camera First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.
Love the camera It's fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire .
Love the features but... I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose.
Love the Fire We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
Love the kindle Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.
"Love the Kindle Fire. I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it."
Love the Kindle Tablets Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.
Love the larger sized screen I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
Love the size of the screen! My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.
Love the Tablet I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
love this for games My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!
Love this pad Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.
Love this tablet Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
Love this tablet I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.
"Love this tablet Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,"
Love this tablet Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix
"Love this tablet! I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
Love this tablet! I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!
Love this tablet. Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.
Love using Kindle Fire Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
"Love, Love, Love I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded!"
"Love, love, love, it This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one"
"Love, loved it, but I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you."
"Loved my 7"" Kindle, love this one too. Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked."
Lovely update Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile!
"Loving it! Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
Loving it! I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can't do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product.
Loving it! I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!
"Low budget tab I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it."
Low cost tablet that works well This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
"Low cost, effective, internet device I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device."
Machine meets all expectations I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
Makes a great Christmas present Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around
"Makes a great gift for first time Tablet Users I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
"Makes a great gift. I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase."
Mom Loves it Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
Mom Loves it Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
"Mom's Firestick As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
"More capabilities than I was expecting... Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available."
More ideal for a child or teen. This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
"most for the money I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK."
Mother's Day Gift I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.
Mr Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
"Much better This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
"Much better than Fire 7"", for slightly more money Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books."
Much quicker than previous model I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.
Must have tablet! Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
My 2nd Kindle I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet.
"My 3rd Tablet Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn't good, I wouldn't be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product!"
"my 7-year-old loves it I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price."
MY AMAZON FIRE ROCKS I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
My daughter loved it .Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet

My favorite Kindle I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job
My fiancee' enjoyed her new toy! Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise!
"My fourth Kindle-Love Them I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest."
My kids love it... they get to watch tv on it. It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...
"My Kindle fire 8 I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it."

"Need guide/instructions When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
"Need more Apps It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally."
Needed something to read books This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.
Needed the bigger tablet. I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
Needs manual for basic functions. Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.
"Nephew Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music."
New and improved kindle Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
New and improved Kindle Fire! Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!
New Fire My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!
"New Fire HD8 The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet."
"New fireHD8 I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading."
New vs older movied My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile.

Nice and fast Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.

nice beginner tablet i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.

Nice for the price Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
"Nice for the price ! I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials."
Nice Gift Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.
"Nice HD tablet Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more?"
"Nice improvements over the previous generations I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!"
nice in a price the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
"Nice little tablet for the price Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
"Nice lower priced tablet For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
Nice pad Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
Nice product Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.

Nice product for a beginner Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment.
nice product for the money PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
"Nice screen resolution. Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
"Nice size Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
"Nice size - Very Readable This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable."
"nice small tablet I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it"
nice small tablet the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire
Nice tablet Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.

Nice tablet Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
Nice Tablet Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
Nice tablet This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.
"Nice tablet We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it."
"Nice tablet Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
Nice tablet at a great price! Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate.
"Nice tablet for 6 year old Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
"Nice Tablet For a Great Price Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory."
Nice tablet for amazon users Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.
Nice tablet for beginner Bought this tablet for a relative for Christmas who wanted access to audiobooks. My only issue is that the tablet needs a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps. Not a problem if you have constant access to wifi but my relative does not. Nice tablet otherwise.
Nice tablet for books and videos An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!
"nice tablet for everydayuse love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues"
"Nice tablet for my son We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it"
Nice tablet for price I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me.
Nice Tablet for the Money This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.
Nice Tablet for the Price I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
nice tablet for the price! I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet.
"Nice tablet for the price. Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading."
"Nice tablet for the price. I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
Nice tablet for the price. This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it.
Nice tablet for the price. This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
"Nice tablet, fantastic value There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding."
"Nice tablet, little slow Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
"Nice tablet, simple to use Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet"
"Nice tablet! I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too."
Nice tool! More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
Nice travel companion Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
"nice tv needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us"
"Nice unit. Good price. I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer."
"nice upgrade Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media."
Nice upgrade Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member.
Nice upgrade I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase.
"Nice Upgrade This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password."
"Nice upgrade from 7"" Amazon Tablet Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket"
Nice! Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
Nice. Hoping it keeps charge. I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
Nicely priced beginner tablet. While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
No Complaints This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..
No complaints here Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
"No Flashy, does it's job. Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device."
non functional!!! horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
"Not a very good camera . The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one ."
"Not ad happy with this one by far I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
"Not an iPad by any means This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead."
Not as good as I thought it would be I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I'm disappointed as it's really too big too easily carry around. I've discovered it's not all that easy to use it for reading purposes
"Not bad This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
"Not bad for $60 BF Deal This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
"not bad, but... I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
"Not bad, just not my flavor of android. This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2."
Not charging well Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
Not for computer beginner Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
Not for me I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking
"Not like the older model Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
Not so much Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
"Not what I expected I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading."
Not What She Wanted My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.
"NOT WORTH IT I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
"Oh my LAWD Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!"
ok bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
"Ok for a young person I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
Ok for the price Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
Ok for the price The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
Ok tablet I'm used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate
Okay for a small tablet Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
"Okay Tablet The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
"Okay tablet Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
"Okay, but not the best It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use."
okkkkkk ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok
Older Grand Kid Gift The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet.
OMG I LOVE THIS FIRE Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
"One flaw Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
"One of my best ""Best Buy"" prurchases! Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications."
One of the best Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.
One of the best fire tablets I've purchased so far Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
Only downside is it's not a phone Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it's a bargain
Only Wish I would have bought it sooner It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.
Outstanding Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
Outstanding quality; great value My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.
Outstanding replacement for my 5-year old Kindle Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read
Outstanding speed I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.
"Outstanding value! I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
"Overall a good tablet for the money Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value."
"overall good product,bright color screen. my 7"" wore out,my 8"" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !"
Overall great prodcut Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
"Overall great product Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
Overall great sound & screen quality. The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
Overall has great functionality! The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.
perfect awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use
"Perfect Bought as a gift for my Mom. She's so happy. Therefore, I'm happy"

Perfect for a beginner. Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.
Perfect for a gift Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
"Perfect for artist reference photos! Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price."
Perfect for emails I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!
"perfect for first time user purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
Perfect for grandkids Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle.
Perfect for kids My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others.
Perfect for My Dad This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.

"Perfect for reading books If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect."

Perfect for what I wanted it for. It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.
"Perfect gift My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great."
Perfect Gift My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
Perfect gift We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
Perfect gift for mom Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise!
Perfect gift! Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price!
"Perfect Lightweight Tablet My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy!"
Perfect purchase My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.
"Perfect reading device Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools."
"Perfect Size After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use."
PERFECT SIZE I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.
Perfect size Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
Perfect size The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
"Perfect size for daily use, good battery life After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet."
Perfect size for my nephew This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
Perfect size screen for easy viewing This product is easy to use and take along with you
Perfect size tablet and easy to set up. Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list.

Perfect step up from a kindle Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)
Perfect tablet Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
Perfect tablet for a beginner This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.
Perfect tablet for books We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
"Perfect tablet for young children We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied."
"Perfect tablet that doesn't break the bank This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer."
"Perfect tablet! Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go!"
PERFECT! I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
PERFECT! We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!
Perfect.price Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.
Performs as expected Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected
picked one up for fun and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
"Pleasanty Surprised I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption."
Pleased This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
Poor charging Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device.
poor photo quality Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
powerful small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
"Powerful tablet Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money"
"Powerful, but not easy to use Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
Prefer it to the Nook I had Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.
Present for grandpa Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
Present for my daughter & she loves it! My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
Pretty Decent This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
"Pretty good... This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
Pretty nice Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
Pretty nice. Light weight I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
"Price is great but limited to Amazon Apps The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library."
"Price was right I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
"Priced Right Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without."
"Priced to sell, nice little unit! Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!"
Product Review This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
product works real well. We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.
Purchased as a Christmas Gift The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
Purchased as a gift I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
Purchased as a gift Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.
"Purchased for Mother as a present And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started."
"Purchased for my 11yr old son.. This is perfect for him! Bought it as a reader for his books, which we either download from Amazon Prime or the local public library. Nice quality screen resolution, ease of use and durability are a plus."
Purchased to replace my iPad I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago.
"Quality Product at Great Price The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
"Quality upgrade for Fire users This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
"quick delivery, great price still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too."
"Quit charging I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging."
Reader I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline. Great price.
Readers delight I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!
Reading lover My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!
"Really decent tablet This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends!"
"Really good A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better."
"Really good picture Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link"
Really good tablet for my granddaughter. My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future.
"Really great for the price! Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
Really great tablet for the price This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction.
Really love my new Kindle. Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.
"Reasonable price for beginner I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I'm sure I will learn more as needed."
recommended by a friend. It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
Repeat purchaser This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
Replace a tablet Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
Replacement for Nabi This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
"Replacement for non-working ""old"" Kindle Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games."
"Replacement purchase Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!"
"Replacing older 7"" Amazon Fire I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet."
Replacing the Original Kindle E-Reader My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!!
"Returned it.. SLOW!!! We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad."
returned item Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
Right size and weight Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old
Sad It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
"Same format as smartphone. I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did."
"Satisfied For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic."
"Satisfied Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet."
Saves on our phone data usage Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I've used it a few times and like it.
"Second Kindle This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend."
"Second Kindle For My Son We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
short life Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
should have operating instructions included good value for the money ..............................................................................................................
should have purchased sooner For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
"Simple Tablet, Great Features This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture."
Size and price good. Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
Small And Compact This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
smiles bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
"Snappy, value tablet This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing"
So convenient and easy to use!! Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
"So far I love it! After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking."
"So far so good I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
So Far So Good Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory.
"So far so good This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
So far so good This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up
"so fast I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
So great I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
"So many nice features I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience."
So very happy with the new kindle ! So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !
Solid We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!
"solid tablet bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features..."
"Solid tablet with potential I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
"some improvements over my earlier version This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don't have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor's or dentist's office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.."
Son loves it Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
"Splendid Reader Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased."
"Step up from fire6 My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which."
"Still figuring it out still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
Still having problems with my camera figuring it o I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
"Still prefer iPad or android tablet Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
stopped working after 3 weeks. the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
"Streams movies great So much better than my previous kindle, I've used my new kindle daily and I'm not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well"
Super I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.
Super fast Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them.
super item This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.
"Super Nice Tablet I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one."
Super present Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
Super tablet for the price Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
Surprisingly GOOD I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
Sweet tablet The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
Sweet tablet for on a budget. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it and uses it every day. She's very picky about electronics and she loves her tablet so it must be good!
tablet daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it.
"tablet Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
Tablet Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient.
Tablet I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
"Tablet Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale."
Tablet Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
Tablet My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present
Tablet Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.
Tablet Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use.
Tablet Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use.
tablet This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off
Tablet This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do
"Tablet gift I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.."
"Tablet nice, not so nice battery though Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging"
Teenagers love it! Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
"TERRIBLE DONT BUY i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
Terrific Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.
"Terrific little tablet, if you don't mind the Ads. I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I've added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of ""free"" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.)"
Terrific tablet for its size. Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
Terrifico Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature.
"The best budget tablet The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc..."
The best tablet This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix.
The best tablet! Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well.
The camera is awful! Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
"The Definition of Value This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!"
the first Fire HD8 we purchased died The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
"The Kindle Fire 8 is awesome! I purchased the Kindle Fire 8"" after owning a 7"" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version."
"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done."
The perfect reader The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
The Perfect Tablet I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
"Think it is a good product It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
This Fire works great for the person I gave it to. I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!!
"This is a great size for commuting This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly!"
"this is a great tablet i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
This is a very good lower priced tablet This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc.
"this is amazing, i love it i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime"
This is great for a second reader My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
This is my 4th one. Love them My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome.
This is the clearest screen ive ever seen this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
"This is the third Kindle I have purchased. Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money."
"This is very convenient It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price"
"this product has great features, and good history the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
"This Product Is On Fire!! I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: ""A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone!"
"This tablet was nice, but... I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!"
"Too good to pass up! I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
"Too may preloaded useless apps This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
"Too slow for browsing I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
Unable to use it I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
upgrade awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire
Upgrade from fire 7HD The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!
USE IT EVERY DAY whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Use my kindle 8 more than my laptop! I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
"Useful aid The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge."
User friendly Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
User friendly Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
Value for money! Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
"Value for money. Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
"Very competent tablet for the price. I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration."
"Very competitive with iPad to the touch Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet."
Very Cool for teen My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
"Very descent Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
Very easy tablet to use This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
very easy to use I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use
very easy to use We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value
"Very easy to use. This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
very fast great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
"Very functional tablet Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners."
"Very good Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use."
"Very Good For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective."
Very good Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I'm traveling!!
Very Good It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
Very good Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.
Very good Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
"Very good for reading, email, internet Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,"
Very Good Product This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great.
"Very good product so far Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price"
"very good quality for the $ Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
"very good tablet Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi."
"Very Good tablet Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
Very good tablet Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children.
"Very good tablet and best price Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
Very Good Tablet for the Money I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
"Very Good! OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!"
very happy this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
"Very Happy Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
"Very happy with my purchase I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want."
"Very happy with Tablet First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good!"
Very happy with this purchase Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
"Very happy. Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones."
"Very limited capabilities. Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found."
"Very Nice The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7."
"Very nice This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand."
Very nice Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
"very nice surprise I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
"Very nice tablet I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the ""educational"" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself."
"Very nice tablet I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
"Very nice tablet This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones."
"very nice tablet for the price The new tablet is great ÔºÅ nice upgradesÔºÅLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web."
Very nice tablett I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
"Very nice, east for child Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly!"
"Very pleased with tablet! The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
"Very pleased with the Kindle I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one."
Very poor. Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
Very useful for the low cost Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
"Very useful in reading and in using the internet. I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics."
Very user friendly I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them.
Very user friendly for beginner Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
"Very user friendly! Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person."
"very userfriendly The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful"
"Very versatile tablet. I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
Very versatile. This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
Wanted it for pictures to show and it works great. It is better than we expected and couldn't be happier.
"Was a gift Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store."
"Was for my wife who loves it This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
Was looking for an Kindle More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books.
Wasn't for me Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
"Watching videos, great..then.. My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one."
We purchased for our 8 year old who loves tablets We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
"Well improved Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well"
"Well worth the money! The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn't lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase!"
Well worth the price. I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
"What a deal! This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too."
WHAT CAN I SAY YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
"Wife absolutley loves her new Fire HD 8 tablet Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
Wife bought for me! I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
wife love it got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
Wife loves it My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.
"Wife LOVES it We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range."
"Wife loves it! My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it!"
Wife loves it. This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
"With Amazon Prime it is a great tablet This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well."
"Woks great! Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
"Won't unlock Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
Wonderful The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices.
Wonderful buy for the money spent Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer!
Wonderful product! This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.
"Wonderful starter for a child I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok."
Wonderful Tablet This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup.
Wonderful Tablet for Anyone I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!
Wonderful thus far Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
"Works as advertised, but the ads get annoying As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying."
Works As Advertised! Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!
"Works exactly as described Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
"Works fine I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
works fine for my youngest I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!
"Works fine so far. Tends to change screens. Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far."
Works good. Easy setup. I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
Works great Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend
"Works great Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it"
Works great Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
Works great I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers
"works great it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
"Works great Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
Works great Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view
Works great Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
"Works great for classes We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals"
Works great for my 6 yr old So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
works great for my dad Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather
"Works great for what I need. I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect!"
"works great, but..... the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
works great. make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.
works grood this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon
"Works pretty good for a great price Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos."
"works very well. much better than the old ""fire"" This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good."
works well the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
"Works well but too tied to Amazon. The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
"Works well, but Needs Better Parental Options The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
Worlks as advertised Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games
Worth every dime!! I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.
worth having the product to kids this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
Worth it !! The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.
"Would buy again Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy."
"wow, over the top happy its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader."
"Wow! Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
Xmas gift I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read
yes it is a great tablet. I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.
"You get a lot for the price! Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price."
"You get the entire World for less than $100! This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!"
"You get what your paying for At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
